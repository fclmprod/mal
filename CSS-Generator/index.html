    <h1>Grids</h1>
    <h2><em>October</em>, Vol. 9 (Summer, 1979)</h2>
    <p>One has to travel a long way back into the history of art to find previous
    examples of grids. One has to go to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, to
    treatises on perspective and to those exquisite studies by Uccello or Leonardo or
    Diirer, where the perspective lattice is inscribed on the depicted world as the
    armature of its organization. But perspective studies are not really early instances
    of grids. Perspective was, after all, the science of the real, not the mode of
    withdrawal from it. Perspective was the demonstration of the way reality and its
    representation could be mapped onto one another, the way the painted image and
    its real-world referent did in fact relate to one another-the first being a form of
    knowledge about the second. Everything about the grid opposes that relationship,
    cuts it off from the very beginning. Unlike perspective, the grid does not map the
    space of a room or a landscape or a group of figures onto the surface of a painting.
    Indeed, if it maps anything, it maps the surface of the painting itself. It is a
    transfer in which nothing changes place. The physical qualities of the surface, we
    could say, are mapped onto the aesthetic dimensions of the same surface. And
    those two planes-the physical and the aesthetic-are demonstrated to be the same
    plane: coextensive, and, through the abscissas and ordinates of the grid, coordinate.
    Considered in this way, the bottom line of the grid is a naked and determined
    materialism.
    But if it is materialism that the grid would make us talk about-and there
    seems no other logical way to discuss it-that is not the way that artists have ever
    discussed it. If we open any tract-Plastic Art and Pure Plastic Art or The NonObjective
    World, for instance-we will find that Mondrian and Malevich are not
    discussing canvas or pigment or graphite or any other form of matter. They are
    talking about Being or Mind or Spirit. From their point of view, the grid is a
    staircase to the Universal, and they are not interested in what happens below in
    the Concrete. Or, to take a more up-to-date example, we could think about Ad
    Reinhardt who, despite his repeated insistence that "Art is art," ended up by
    painting a series of black nine-square grids in which the motif that inescapably
    emerges is a Greek cross. There is no painter in the West who can be unaware of
    the symbolic power of the cruciform shape and the Pandora's box of spiritual
    reference that is opened once one uses it.

    In the temporal dimension, the grid is an emblem of modernity by being just
    that: the form that is ubiquitous in the art of our century, while appearing
    nowhere, nowhere at all, in the art of the last one. In that great chain of reactions
    by which modernism was born out of the efforts of the nineteenth century, one
    final shift resulted in breaking the chain. By "discovering" the grid, cubism, de
    Stijl, Mondrian, Malevich . .. landed in a place that was out of reach of everything
    that went before. Which is to say, they landed in the present, and everything else
    was declared to be the past.

    Now it is in this ambivalence about the import of the grid, an indecision
    about its connection to matter on the one hand or spirit on the other, that its
    earliest employers can be seen to be participating in a drama that extended well
    beyond the domain of art. That drama, which took many forms, was staged in
    many places. One of them was a courtroom, where early in this century, science
    did battle with God, and, reversing all earlier precedents, won. The result, we were
    told by the loser's representative, would have the direst of consequences: the result
    would surely be that we would "inherit the wind." Nietzsche had expressed this
    earlier and with a somewhat more comic cast when he wrote, "We wished to
    awaken the feeling of man's sovereignty by showing his divine birth: this path is
    now forbidden, since a monkey stands at the entrance." Through the Scopes trial,
    the split between spirit and matter that was presided over by nineteenth-century
    science became the legitimate heritage of twentieth-century school children. But it
    was, of course, no less the heritage of twentieth-century art.
    Given the absolute rift that had opened between the sacred and the secular,
    the modern artist was obviously faced with the necessity to choose between one
    mode of expression and the other. The curious testimony offered by the grid is that
    at this juncture he tried to decide for both. In the increasingly de-sacralized space
    of the nineteenth century, art had become the refuge for religious emotion; it
    became, as it has remained, a secular form of belief. Although this condition could
    be discussed openly in the late nineteenth century, it is something that is inadmissable
    in the twentieth, so that by now we find it indescribably embarrassing
    to mention art and spirit in the same sentence.
    The peculiar power of the grid, its extraordinarily long life in the specialized
    space of modern art, arises from its potential to preside over this shame: to mask
    and to reveal it at one and the same time. In the cultist space of modern art, the
    grid serves not only as emblem but also as myth. For like all myths, it deals with
    paradox or contradiction not by dissolving the paradox or resolving the contradiction,
    but by covering them over so that they seem (but only seem) to go away. The
    grid's mythic power is that it makes us able to think we are dealing with
    materialism (or sometimes science, or logic) while at the same time it provides us
    with a release into belief (or illusion, or fiction). The work of Reinhardt or Agnes
    Martin would be instances of this power. And one of the important sources of this
    power is the way the grid is, as I said before, so stridently modern to look at,
    seeming to have left no place of refuge, no room on the face of it, for vestiges of the
    nineteenth century to hide.
    In suggesting that the success' of the grid is somehow connected to its
    structure as myth, I may of course be accused of stretching a point beyond the
    limits of common sense, since myths are stories, and like all narratives they
