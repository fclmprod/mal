<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>The essential articles of furniture in a modern composing room may be
classified broadly, omitting obvious details for the present, under the
following heads:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. <span class="smcap">Cases</span> for type for general composition; for borders, type
ornaments, accented letters, fractions, extra sorts, etc., and for
engraved plates, and electrotypes; for spaces and quads, brass
rules, leads, slugs, metal furniture and large spacing material,
and for wood type. Also cases in special cabinets for printed
specimens, paper samples, etc.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Work Stands and Cabinets</span>—Open wooden frames with or without
racks, to hold cases on top; made single or double; with working
top. Cabinets, with working top, holding cases, enclosed on sides
and back; made single, double, or triple size. Cabinets are made of
pressed steel as well as of hard wood.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Cabinets and Storage Racks for Cases</span>—In addition to the racks
in working stands and cabinets, there are standing racks, cabinets
(flat top for holding miscellaneous articles or material, and
galley top for temporary storage of live or dead matter), etc.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Galley Cabinets and Racks</span>—These are to hold galley matter
waiting return of proofs, or for pages made up and waiting to be
locked up for electro foundry or for the pressroom. They may be
placed in any convenient place, or are sometimes in movable form to
be taken from composing or correcting stands to the make-up stand
or imposing table.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Furniture Racks and Cabinets</span>—For labor-saving fonts of reglet,
wood furniture, soft metal or steel furniture, etc.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>6. <span class="smcap">Standing Galleys</span>—These are stands with inclined tops divided
sometimes horizontally and sometimes perpendicularly into narrow
columns, for holding live or dead standing matter—usually the
latter awaiting distribution. The lower part of the frame is
usually provided with racks for cases, letter-boards, galleys, or
other storage facilities.</p>

<p>7. <span class="smcap">Imposing Tables</span>—Large flat surfaces upon which pages and forms
are imposed and locked up for electrotype molding or prepared for
the press. These consist of polished marble slabs on strong frames
or tables, with drawer for quoins, etc., and also furnished below
with galley racks, receptacles for wood or metal furniture,
letter-boards, chase racks, etc. The more common modern imposing
tables are made of steel, on iron frames, with the lower parts
fitted for the storage of material used in locking up forms.</p>

<p>8. <span class="smcap">Proofing Apparatus</span>—Proof planer and mallet, galley press, hand
press, modern curved-surface machines, automatic proofing machines,
self-feeding and self-inking. These also include proof rollers, ink
tables, shelves for proof paper, and receptacles for benzine or
other type-washing liquids.</p></blockquote>

<p>In addition to the foregoing brief summary there are numerous other
items of composing-room equipment, large and small, provided for the
particular needs of the work carried on in the place. Many of these
items, however, are not in extensive use, as in many places the needs
they would serve might not warrant the expense of their installation.
The specialties of the printing industry nowadays affect the
composing-room as well as the other departments.</p>

<p>A particular article which is useful and profitable in one place may be
quite superfluous and an unnecessary expense in another. The kind and
quantity of the work done in any workroom usually governs the kind and
the extent of the equipment provided—making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> allowance always for the
customary variation in individual judgment and the proprietor's ability
to purchase.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of choice from a plain wooden double stand with
two pairs of cases, at which two persons may work, costing six to ten
dollars, to a latest pattern steel working cabinet, also providing for
only two workers, costing one hundred dollars, or even more.</p>

<p>There are, however, certain articles and facilities fundamentally
necessary to carry on the work of a composing room. The particular form
of these—whether simple and inexpensive or elaborate and costly—is a
question for the proprietor or manager to consider.</p>

<p>The articles of furniture classified under items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, in
the foregoing list, are those treated in this book; those referred to in
item 7, Imposing Tables and Lock-Up Appliances, being considered in a
separate volume (No. 4). Proof Presses, item 8, are also treated in a
separate book (No. 5).</p>

<h3><i>Early Type Cases</i></h3>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 162px;">
<a href="images/fig010-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig010-300dpi.png" width="162" height="207" alt="Fig. 1. Early Type Case." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Early Type Case.</span>
</span>
Probably the first article which Gutenberg and his co-workers provided,
after their types were cast, was a tray with small compartments for
holding the various letters of the font, so that each letter, as it was
required for composing, could be readily selected. There may not have
been a composing stick used at first, it is reasonable to suppose, as it
was quite feasible for the types to be assembled in lines directly into
the frames in which they were held during the printing. A case in which
to hold the type, however, was a first and obvious necessity.</p>

<p>The early type cases are shown in pictures of the time as made of a
single tray containing all the characters of the font and resting in a
slanting position on a rude frame or “horse,” at which the compositor is
usually seated. All the boxes of the case are represented as of the same
size, which probably was not the fact even in early practice any more
than it is today. Early designers and artists no doubt overlooked or
ignored what they considered an unimportant detail, just as today they
often persist in misrepresenting the true outline of the printer's
lower-case. One does not need to take much thought or to have much
experience to understand that in all printed languages some characters
are used more than others and therefore more types of these letters and
larger boxes to hold them should be provided.</p>

<p>For a long time the large single case with boxes for the entire list of
characters was used, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> are still common in many European
composing rooms. In English and American workshops, however, the pair of
cases, one above the other, for many years has been the rule for large
fonts in book and news work. These cases, being smaller and holding but
a part of the font, are more convenient for storing and for moving from
place to place about the room as they are needed for use.
</p>

<p>The cases described by Moxon in 1683 are in pairs, and the arrangement
of the letters in the lower case, as shown in his illustrations, bear a
close similarity to the plan of English cases of today.</p>

<p>Early American cases came from England and naturally they conformed to
the customs of the time and place of origin. Probably in no other
important particular has the tendency of printers to hold to past
methods been more strongly emphasized than in their refusal to adopt any
important change in the style of the most used type cases and the
arrangement of the types in the boxes. Force of habit and dislike for
innovation have kept practically unchanged for two and a half centuries
the relative positions of the chief characters in the case. At the same
time there has been universal acknowledgment that the adoption of some
of the suggested improvements would add greatly to convenience and
economy; and further, that many of these improvements could be adopted
with an effort and expense so small as to be out of all proportion to
the advantages obtained.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 2-b. Lower Case.</span>
</span>

The standard type case of today is 32¼ inches wide, as it lies on the
work-stand, and 16⅝ inches—or slightly more than one half of the
width—from the front to the back or upper edge. The usual depth of the
outside frame is 1⅜ inches, the minor inside partitions being
slightly lower than the outside frame and middle crossbar, thus making
the normal depth of the boxes approximately 1 inch. These dimensions
vary only by fractions of an inch from those given by Moxon, and they
seem to have been quite uniformly adhered to as an acceptable size for
printers' cases.</p>

<p>Other sizes of cases, however, have been made and quite commonly used
during the last half century. Those now listed in the dealers' catalogs
are known as three-quarter size (26½ inches wide by 16⅝ inches
front to back) and two-third size (21¾ by 16⅝ inches). There is
also another size known as the Rooker case, used to some extent in
newspaper composing rooms, the dimensions being 28½ x 14 inches,
which is about one-fifth smaller than the standard case. It holds nearly
the same quantity of the smaller sizes of type and has the advantage of
occupying less room.</p>

<p>When printing offices employed but few workmen and there was small
equipment, the need for economizing space did not seem a pressing one.
Large cases with small fonts, and open-frame working stands with few or
no racks or shelves for storage of extra material, were not considered
extravagant so long as the original cost was small. The employment of
larger numbers of workmen, however, and the consequent additional
equipment of cases, with racks, cabinets, imposing tables, and other
facilities concentrated in city buildings where the cost of rent, light,
heat, etc., is high and constantly increasing, have made the utilization
of waste space a matter of urgent necessity. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> three-quarter,
two-third cases, and even smaller sizes, which can be kept in smaller
racks and cabinets, have therefore been found convenient in many places,
but these must be provided with suitable racks or cabinets of the proper
size. The smaller cases are sufficient to hold many of the usual small
fonts, as well as the ordinary auxiliary material, like type borders,
ornaments, small electros, etc. Small cases, with their lesser weight of
contents in type metal, often give distinct advantage in the ease with
which they may be handled.</p>




<h3><a name="STRUCTURE_OF_TYPE_CASES" id="STRUCTURE_OF_TYPE_CASES"></a><i>Structure of Type Cases</i></h3>

<p>Type cases are made of wood thoroughly seasoned to prevent as much as
possible any shrinking after they are finished and have remained for
some time in the usually dry air of a composing room. It is not so
common a custom now, as it was formerly, to sponge type on the galley
before distributing and to allow the surplus water to flow into the
case, thus subjecting parts of the case to excessive dampness. The old
type cases, under such careless usage, were quickly warped and cracked.
The splitting of the bottom and the separation of the partitions allowed
small types to drop out and to shift under the partitions. These defects
were partially overcome by papering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> bottoms of the boxes, the
proper accomplishment of which was at one time considered a part of the
compositor's duty.</p>

<p>
<span class="figright" style="width: 204px;">
<a href="images/fig013a-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig013a-300dpi.png" width="204" height="67" alt="Fig. 3. Section Showing Triple-Veneer Bottom of Case." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 3. Section Showing Triple-Veneer Bottom of Case.</span>
</span>
The modern American type case is better made than its predecessors,
being so far superior in several essential particulars as to be a
distinct achievement in factory woodwork. A type case, with 49 to 100 or
more small boxes, is not a simple thing to make by hand labor. While the
making of the outside frame and the bottom involve no special
difficulties, the box partitions and their proper fastening to each
other and to the bottom of the case require patience and skill. Only a
highly developed system of specialization could provide the cases of
today at the prevailing cost.</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 171px;">
<a href="images/fig013b-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig013b-300dpi.png" width="171" height="102" alt="Fig. 4. Detail of Type Case, showing at A how bottom is
fitted to side frame." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 4. Detail of Type Case, showing at A how bottom is

</span>
<span class="figright" style="width: 132px;">
<a href="images/fig014-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig014-300dpi.png" width="132" height="124" alt="Fig. 5. Clasp and Pin Fastening at corners of boxes in
modern type case." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 5. Clasp and Pin Fastening at corners of boxes in
modern type case.</span>
</span>
The bottom of the old-time case warped and split easily because it was
made of a single thin board. The modern case has a bottom made of
three-ply wood, the middle layer having the grain across that of the
other two. (Fig. 3.) These three layers are thoroughly glued together
and the upper side is smoothly covered with a strong paper before the
partitions are fastened to the bottom. The common styles of case have a
strong bar of the same thickness as the outside frame across the middle.
In several styles there are two or even more crossbars. These crossbars
serve not only to divide the main sections of boxes, but they also act
as strong braces to which the bottoms are fastened, giving greater
rigidity to the entire case.</p>

<p>The bottom of the case is fitted into a groove made in the outside
frame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> so that it cannot be easily separated. This groove being
slightly higher than the lower face of the side frame, upon which the
case slides back and forth in the rack, keeps the bottom up far enough
to allow it to pass clear of the runs, or of any case or shelf below.
The partitions are made by strips across the full width of each section
of the case from outer frame to outer frame or to crossbar. The strips
are crossed at the corners of the boxes by mortising each piece one half
of its depth at the proper place—one from above and the other from
below—and dovetailing the cross pieces together. (Fig. 4.) The corners
of the boxes are then re-enforced by brass clasps made to fit over the
top of the partitions and held by a long pin driven down through the
dovetailed partitions and clinched at the bottom of the case. (See Fig.
5.).</p>

<p>While wooden cases are used by printers chiefly for holding type fonts,
they are now also used for a large variety of auxiliary material which
it is necessary to keep more or less carefully classified in convenient
containers. The increasing quantities and varieties of this material now
needed in an average composing-room make convenient receptacles and
orderly, systematic arrangement a necessity if the work is to be carried
on without excessive waste. In no other trade is there a greater
multiplicity of details to be considered in order to obtain a finished
product, and a thoughtless, unnecessary waste of time, effort, or
material in attending to these details adds enormously to the expense of
the product. And so it is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> the practice of good managers to use
cases more abundantly than formerly and to store them in convenient
racks and cabinets, so that this large mass of material may be kept
classified and may be obtained quickly when needed.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary pair of upper case and lower case, many styles of
single cases are made to hold a complete font of capitals, lower case,
figures, points, etc., and others are planned to hold small capitals in
addition. Some are made for fonts of capitals, figures, and points only;
some for figures only (especially for time-tables and tabular work), for
fractions, accented letters, special characters and sorts, for leaders,
type borders and ornaments, etc. A large variety of cases are planned
for labor-saving fonts of brass rule. Others are made especially for
spaces and quads, for leads and slugs, and for metal furniture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> These
are made in many sizes, from the small space-and-rule case, 5 inches by
6¼ inches, which can be placed beside the compositor's galley, up to
the mammoth metal furniture case, 18 inches by 72 inches, covering a
space equal to the top of a double stand. Dealers' catalogs now show
from seventy-five to a hundred or more different kinds of cases for
printers' use.</p>

</span>
Primarily a working case-stand for a compositor serves two purposes. It
should hold the cases in a position where he can work with reasonable
comfort, and it should be fitted to contain the necessary material for
his immediate use. For the first purpose the height of the case, working
top, or shelf, should conform approximately to a level that will be
comfortable for the individual workman. A tall man may work easily at a
case which would be too high for the comfort of an apprentice, and a
case at the right elevation for one below the average height would cause
a habit of tiresome, if not unhealthful, stooping in a tall person. It
often happens in some places that such conditions may not be adjusted
without some bother, and an uncomfortable temporary position may not be
a serious matter for very brief periods. The tendency in well-managed
workrooms, however, is to remedy such improper situations and not to
permit workmen to work habitually under conditions which may be easily
improved. “The height of a compositor and his frame,” said an early
authority among printers, “should be so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> adjusted that his right elbow
may just clear the front of the lower case by the <i>a</i> box, without the
smallest elevation of the shoulder”; and this seems a wise general rule
to observe.</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 341px;">
<a href="images/fig018a-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig018a-300dpi.png" width="341" height="121" alt="Fig. 17. Compositor&#39;s Work Stand—Rear View." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 17. Compositor&#39;s Work Stand—Rear View.</span>
</span>When the type case is placed at a height at which the compositor may
stand erect before it, the boxes are more readily reached by the hand if
the back of the case is at a slight elevation. A case lying perfectly
flat must be somewhat lower, in relation to the compositor's arms, than
when it is resting at an inclination, in order to take types from it
with the same facility. Consequently the custom is to place working
cases and working tops or shelves at an inclination upward from the
front to the back.</p>

<p>This inclination serves also as the most convenient kind of a rest for
galleys upon which loose lines of composed matter are handled. Lines of
small type will not stand upright without support of some kind, even on
a perfectly level, smooth, rigid surface. The universal custom,
therefore, is to place galleys of type matter in a slanting position, so
that the ends of the lines will be higher and all the matter will rest
firmly against the lower rim of the galley. A galley in this slanting
position, with the first letter in the line resting against the lower
rim and the words reading upward, is the safest and most practicable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
manner in which to make corrections, lift out or insert whole lines
singly or in groups, or to handle types generally in certain difficult
composition, making-up pages, etc. After the pages are tied up or
surrounded by side supports in some manner they may be conveniently
handled on a level surface. Ordinary linotyped matter, which consists of
a single piece for each line of words, and consequently is not liable to
pi, may be, and usually is, handled throughout on level tables; but
types are easily and safely handled only when they may be placed against
the lower rim of an inclined galley.</p>

<p>A simple and inexpensive working stand to hold type cases for composing
is that shown in Fig. 18. This is made of wood and has a rack in the
lower part for holding extra cases. It will be noticed that because the
rack is wide enough to take the full-size case, the top of the stand is
several inches wider than the case, and the side frames are therefore
too far apart to support the ends of the case. To enable the cases to be
held safely, an extra arm is placed inside near the side frame to hold
one end of the case. The surplus space beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> the working cases is
usually furnished with a sloping shelf or narrow galley rest convenient
for holding a galley, leads, or other articles, thus allowing the case
to be kept clear for composing. (See Fig. 19.)</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 23. Double Stand with working cases held on iron

</span>
A rack used to hold cases that are not often used is shown in Fig. 22.
Racks of this kind are made in different sizes to hold ten to thirty
cases, and in double tiers to hold forty to sixty cases.</p>

<p>Tall racks which hold cases too high to be reached comfortably by a
person standing on the floor are not to be commended. While they may
occupy less floor space and because of this seem to be an advantage
where there are a great many cases that are seldom used, this advantage
is usually more than offset by their disadvantages. The upper cases are
difficult to handle and are liable to be pied. If the tall racks are
near a window they obstruct the light.</p>

<p>A double stand of similar character to Fig. 18 is shown in Fig. 21, in
which the space below is fully utilized for two racks, one for full-size
cases and the other for two-third cases.</p>

<p>Many foremen do not approve the small size cases for type in common use,
preferring to have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> the cases of a standard size, so that they may
fit the regular racks and stands and be interchangeable throughout the
department. To provide for this, double stands are made which have a
double tier of racks for full size cases, as shown in Fig. 20. This
double stand has the extra space on the top utilized by a narrow galley
shelf in the middle between the inclined case supports.</p>

<p>Another class of wooden case-stands is made with the frame having a flat
top or table upon which is fastened a set of iron brackets to hold the
working cases in an inclined position. These styles are illustrated in
Fig. 23.</p>

The closed-in cabinet is the modern plan for a compositor's working
stand and for holding cases of type in common use. This is a frame or
stand enclosed at the sides and back to exclude dust and debris from the
cases. The case runs are thin (often of steel) and close together and
the fronts of the cases are made with extra high rims, so that when all
are pushed into place they present a closed front also.</p>

<p>
The printer's cabinet is now made in a multiplicity of styles and in
several sizes. The frames are usually of hard wood, but during the past
few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> years they have been made of pressed steel. Usually they provide
for one or more tiers of standard wooden cases for type, etc. Some of
the latest patterns combine in one structure racks for type cases and
facilities for holding assortments of the various kinds of material
which a compositor ordinarily uses, with provision for some special
material, as well as ample working space for galleys, etc. They are
planned to concentrate the frequently used material near to the
compositor's hands, to enable him to save the time occupied in going
from place to place about the room.</p>

</span>
The old-style working stand or cabinet as illustrated in Figs. 20, 21,
usually made it necessary for a workman to stand directly in front of a
number of cases which he rarely used but which might be frequently used
by other compositors. In small workshops this arrangement offers no
inconvenience and there need be little loss of time or patience among
courteous fellow workmen. In large departments, however, especially
where floor space is pretty fully occupied and the working spaces are
narrow, a permanent workstand directly over a group of cases that are
frequently used by several persons has been found to be an annoying and
time-wasting arrangement.</p>

<p>
About thirty years ago a radical change of this practice was proposed,
and is now being gradually adopted for modern equipments. This plan
places the working stand on one side of the cabinet and the case rack on
the other side, so that there is freer access to cases by all workmen.
The original styles of these stands and cabinets were called “Polhemus,”
after a New York printer, John Polhemus, who <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>arranged his
composing-room in this manner.</p>

<p>The case-front side of the cabinet is provided with a galley top for
holding standing matter, etc., while the opposite side (the closed-in
back of the case rack) is surmounted with brackets for type cases,
galley shelf, etc., and is used as the working stand.</p>

<p>Polhemus cabinets (Figs. 26 and 27) and others embodying this plan have
been made in a variety of sizes—single, double, and triple cabinets,
the larger sizes providing for galley racks and sorts drawers, as well
as the three tiers of type cases.</p>

The cast-iron case brackets used on flat-top wooden cabinets and case
racks are made in a variety of styles. They have advantages over the
case supports formed by the top of side frames of the old style wooden
stands shown in Fig. 21, in that they allow use of the space below the
cases, and provide a more convenient placing of the upper case. The
style of bracket shown on the stands illustrated in Figs. 23 and 30
allows the upper case to be brought nearer to the front, making it
easier to reach all the boxes and yet leave ample room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> to get at the
upper boxes of the lower case. The stand or cabinet may be placed close
against a wall or other frame, as the upper case does not overhang at
the back. The position of the inclined working cases on top may be fixed
at any desired place on the top of the cabinet by changing the position
of the brackets. One style of bracket (Fig. 29) is made to fasten to the
extreme fore edge of the shelf, this bringing the front of the lower
case out beyond the front line of the cabinet.</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 72px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 31. Galley Brackets forming a rack fastened to

</span>
A number of years ago a tilting bracket (shown in Figs. 27 and 28) for
the lower case was introduced and this has been used to some extent. The
ostensible advantage of this is to allow the lower case to be tilted up
from the front so that easier access is given to a galley shelf or other
space under the case. This is a convenience in some instances, but the
unstable nature of the case support is liable to be a disadvantage; a
full case suddenly tilted is likely to cause types to be thrown into
adjoining boxes; or a galley, leads, or other material on top of the
case may slide down back when the case is tipped forward. A style of
bracket which has proved serviceable is that shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> on the case stand in
Fig. 30.</p>


<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 32. Galley Cabinet.</span>

Brackets for holding galleys are furnished in several varieties, one of
which is illustrated in Fig. 31, etc. These are temporary rests for
galleys, while the matter on them is waiting for return of proofs, for
making up, etc. They are fastened to a wall or strong frame in some
out-of-the-way place, or they may be fitted on special standards near
the type cases or the make-up table. The galley cabinet, similar to that
illustrated in Fig. 32, is a more expensive article of furniture for
this purpose, but it is usually more satisfactory.</p>


<h3><a name="WOOD_RUNS_AND_STEEL_RUNS" id="WOOD_RUNS_AND_STEEL_RUNS"></a><i>Wood Runs and Steel Runs</i></h3>

<p>Early wooden case racks were fitted with strips of thin wood upon which
the cases were moved in and out. These slender strips were not always of
perfect grain and were difficult to attach firmly to the side frame.
They warped and split easily, and the nails and screws with which they
were fastened would work loose. In order to have them strong they had to
be thick, and this thickness gave a wide space between the cases so that
fewer cases could be kept in a given space.</p>

<p>To avoid these disadvantages case runs are now made of flat strips of
steel fastened to the side frames of the rack or cabinet. In some
cabinets they are fitted between side slats of wood, and a couple of
perpendicular iron rods are run through holes in the slats and the steel
strips from top to bottom of the rack, binding the pieces together and
to the side frame, making a particularly substantial rack. Another style
of steel run is made of a wider strip of iron bent the entire length
into a right-angle shape. Screw holes on one side of this angle strip
enable it to be fastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> to the side frame, the other angle of the
strip being used to support the case.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 33. Double Case Stand, showing the cases in rack

</span>
In all composing-rooms there are many cases at which it is necessary to
work for only a few moments at a time, to set a single line, or to make
a correction, etc. In order that cases kept in racks or cabinets may be
used quickly it is necessary that each one may be pulled out clear of
the case above, so that all the boxes at the rear are accessible. In the
old-style racks this was attained by having the runs several inches
longer than the width of the case, and placing an upright strip or stop
at the rear to allow the cases to be pushed back far enough to leave
three or more inches of the run exposed in front. This front space is
sufficient to support the case temporarily while it is pulled out from
those above in full view. (Fig. 33.)</p>

<p><span class="figright" style="width: 97px;">
<a href="images/fig026a-300dpifull.png"><img src="images/fig026a-300dpi.png" width="97" height="139" alt="Fig. 34. Extension Front Case Rack." title="" /></a>
<span class="caption">Fig. 34. Extension Front Case Rack.</span>
</span>
In many type cabinets, however, the practice is to keep the front of all
cases flush with the front of the cabinet frame. This allows no front
support for a case that is pulled out far enough to expose all the
boxes, and so the side frames or rims of the cases are extended three or
four inches back beyond the case itself. These extensions serve as stout
arms at the rear of the case to hold it in the front of the rack when
the case is pulled forward. When the case is carefully handled this plan
serves the purpose if the extensions themselves are not drawn entirely
clear of the case above. Its security depends somewhat upon the style of
the runs and how carefully the cases fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> their places. A disadvantage
of this plan is that the cases having these long rear extensions are
awkward to place when they are taken from their racks to be used on top
of ordinary working stands.</p>

<p>The later method of providing for this is to place the cases further
back in the rack, as in the old-style stand, and have the runs on the
cabinet extended entirely to the front. This is the extension front, and
in modern cabinets the rims are of thin steel, as already described.
(Fig. 34.) With this arrangement the cases have no protruding arms and
can be conveniently placed anywhere; standard cabinet cases can be
placed on working stands or temporarily in any convenient case rack.</p>

In the composing-room of a generation ago—and unfortunately in some
unprogressive places today—the strips of blank material known as reglet
and wood furniture were usually kept in disorderly manner in a large box
or drawer under or near the imposing stone. The material was usually
obtained in lengths of one yard and a small hand-saw was at hand to cut
any lengths required. In time there was an accumulation of all sorts
jumbled together in the drawer in a manner to make it difficult to find
needed pieces without loss of time. Often the quickest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> way to obtain
the right piece was to cut off a longer one.</p>

<p>
This wasteful method was the universal custom before the era of the
labor-saving assortment stored in orderly fashion in a cabinet and
placed within instant reach of the workman. The common-sense modern
method is the well-stocked rack or cabinet with a compartment for each
size of the series, with the compartments numbered and the larger pieces
of the material numbered to correspond. An arrangement like this invites
an orderly habit in persons who would otherwise be careless.</p>

<p>The usual style of furniture rack is shown in Fig. 35. This is made in
several sizes to hold quantities large or small according to the
requirements of the room. The position of a rack like this should be
near the stone at a level near the height of the working surface.</p>

<p>Another style of furniture and reglet rack is that fitted into the frame
of the imposing table or into an adjoining stand or cabinet. This is
illustrated in Fig. 36. It will be noticed that all the different
lengths present a surface flush with the outside of the frame. This is
because the depth of the compartments is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> varied to accommodate the
several lengths of furniture at the back, instead of at the front as
shown in Fig. 35.</p>

Among the new articles supplied for the compositor's use are cabinets
for holding assortments of metal furniture, brass rules, leads, slugs,
and small cases or drawers for special material. The tops of some of
these cabinets hold the lead and rule cutter and the rule-mitering
machine, with a small inclined shelf above, as shown in Fig. 38. These
cabinets will hold a large amount of material in small space. When
conveniently situated and properly supplied with material they save time
and effort on the part of the compositor.</p>

<p>Another cabinet that is useful is the script type cabinet. This holds
the cases inclined upward from the left. The compartments are narrow,
running horizontally with the front. In these the types are held face
up, so that they may not be injured by rattling about when the case is
moved back and forth. The cases may be used for borders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> special
characters, or any small items which it is desired to keep standing face
upward. The compartments of the cases may be made wide or narrow to
accommodate the size of the types they are to hold.</p>

<p>The apprentice who wants to learn about the latest and best feature of
composing room equipment should make a special point to examine the
catalogues of manufacturers and dealers in printers' supplies. These
catalogues continually show new and improved articles that are finely
illustrated and specifically described as to their particular
advantages.</p>

<h4>SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS</h4>

<p>The following questions, based on the contents of this pamphlet, are
intended to serve (1) as a guide to the study of the text, (2) as an aid
to the student in putting the information contained into definite
statements without actually memorizing the text, (3) as a means of
securing from the student a reproduction of the information in his own
words.</p>

<p>A careful following of the questions by the reader will insure full
acquaintance with every part of the text, avoiding the accidental
omission of what might be of value. These primers are so condensed that
nothing should be omitted.</p>

<p>In teaching from these books it is very important that these questions
and such others as may occur to the teacher, should be made the basis of
frequent written work, and of final examinations.</p>

<p>The importance of written work cannot be overstated. It not only assures
knowledge of material but the power to express that knowledge correctly
and in good form.</p>

<p>If this written work can be submitted to the teacher in printed form it
will be doubly useful.</p>

<h2><a name="ACKNOWLEDGMENT" id="ACKNOWLEDGMENT"></a>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>


<p>This series of Typographic Text-books is the result of the splendid
co-operation of a large number of firms and individuals engaged in the
printing business and its allied industries in the United States of
America.</p>

<p>The Committee on Education of the United Typothetae of America, under
whose auspices the books have been prepared and published, acknowledges
its indebtedness for the generous assistance rendered by the many
authors, printers, and others identified with this work.</p>

<p>While due acknowledgment is made on the title and copyright pages of
those contributing to each book, the Committee nevertheless felt that a
group list of co-operating firms would be of interest.</p>

<p>The following list is not complete, as it includes only those who have
co-operated in the production of a portion of the volumes, constituting
the first printing. As soon as the entire list of books comprising the
Typographic Technical Series has been completed (which the Committee
hopes will be at an early date), the full list will be printed in each
volume.</p>

<p>The Committee also desires to acknowledge its indebtedness to the many
subscribers to this Series who have patiently awaited its publication.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
