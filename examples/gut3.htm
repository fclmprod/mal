<h2 style="text-shadow: none;">FOREWORD</h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It has been my happy fortune to have made the
acquaintance of the gifted author of this book. From
time to time she was kind enough to confide to me
its progress. When the manuscript was completed
I was privileged to go over it, and the hours so spent
were of unbroken interest and pleasure.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">What especially touched and concerned me was, of
course, the Japanese characters depicted, the motives
of these actors in their respective roles, and other
Japanese incidents connected with the story. I am
most agreeably impressed with the remarkable insight
into, and the just appreciation of, the Japanese
spirit displayed by the author.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">While the story itself is her creation, the local coloring,
the moral atmosphere called in to weave the
thread of the tale, are matters belonging to the domain
of facts, and constitute an amount of useful and
authentic information. Indeed, she has taken unusual
pains to be correctly informed about the people
of the country and their customs, and in this she has
succeeded to a very eminent degree.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">I may mention one or two of the striking characteristics
of the work. The sacrifice of the girl Haru
may seem unreal, but such is the dominant idea of
duty and sacrifice with the Japanese, that in certain
emergencies it is not at all unlikely that we should
behold her real prototype in life. The description of
the Imperial Review at Tokyo and its patriotic significance
vividly recalls my own impression of this
spectacle.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It gives me great satisfaction to know that by perusing
these pages, the vast reading public, who,
after all, have the decisive voice in the national government
of the greatest republic of the world, and
whose good will and friendship we Japanese prize in
no uncommon degree, should be correctly informed
about ourselves, as far as the scope of this book goes.
We attach great importance to a thorough mutual
understanding of two foremost peoples on the Pacific,
in whose direction and co�peration the future of the
East must largely depend. It is, therefore, incumbent
upon us all to do our utmost to cultivate such good
understanding, not only for those immediately concerned,
but for the welfare of the whole human race.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the chapters of this novel the author seems always
to have had such high ideals before her, and the
result is that, besides being an exciting and agreeable
reading, the book contains elements of serious and
instructive consideration, which can not but contribute
toward establishing better and healthier knowledge
between the East and West of the Pacific.</p>

<p class="h1" style="text-shadow: none;">THE KINGDOM<br style="text-shadow: none;">
OF SLENDER SWORDS</p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chI" id="chI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER I<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">WHERE THE DAY BEGINS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</span> leaned against the palpitant rail,
the light air fanning her breeze-cool cheek,
her arteries beating like tiny drums, atune
with the throb, throb, throb, of the steel deck as the
black ocean leviathan swept on toward its harbor
resting-place.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">All that Japanese April day she had been in a
state of tremulous excitement. She had crept from
her berth at dawn to see the hazy sun come up in a
Rosicrucian flush as weirdly soft as a mirage, to
strain her eyes for the first filmy feather of land.
Long before the gray-green wisp showed on the horizon,
the sight of a lumbering <i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i> with its square
sail laced across with white stripes, and its bronze
seamen, with white loin-cloth and sweat-band about
the forehead, naked and thewed like sculptures, as
they swayed from the clumsy tiller, had sent a thrill
through her. And as the first far peaks etched
themselves on the robin's-egg blue, as impalpable
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page2" id="page2" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
and ethereal as a perfume, she felt warm drops coming
with a rush to her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For Japan, every sight and sound of it, had been
woven with the earliest imaginings of Barbara's
orphaned life. Her father she had never seen. Her
mother she remembered only as a vague, widowed
figure. In Japan they two had met and had married,
and after a single year her mother had returned to
her own place and people broken-hearted and alone.
In the month of her return Barbara had been born.
A year ago her aunt, to whom she owed the care of
her young girlhood, had died, and Barbara had
found herself, at twenty-three, mistress of a liberal
fortune and of her own future. Japan had always
exercised a potent spell over her imagination. She
pictured it as a land of strange glowing trees, of
queer costumes and weird, fantastic buildings. More
than all, it was the land of her mother's life-romance,
where her father had loved and died.
There was one other tangible tie�her uncle, her
mother's brother, was Episcopal bishop of Tokyo.
He was returning now from a half year's visit
in America, and this fact, coupled with an invitation
from Patricia Dandridge, the daughter of the
American Ambassador, with whom Barbara had
chummed one California winter, had constituted
an opportunity wholly alluring. So she found herself,
on this April day, the pallid Pacific fuming
away behind her, gazing with kindling cheeks on
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page3" id="page3" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
that shadowy background, vaguely intangible in the
magical limpidity of the distance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The land was wonderfully nearer now. The hills
lay, a clear pile of washed grays and greens, with
saffron tinted valleys between, wound in a haze of
tender lilac. By imperceptible gradations this unfolded,
caught sub-tones, ermine against umbers, of
warmer red and flickering emerald, white glints of
sun on surf like splashes of silver, till suddenly, spectral
and perfect, above a cluster of peaks like purple
gentians, glowed forth a phantom mountain, its
golden wistaria cone inlaid in the deeper azure. It
hung like an inverted morning-glory, mist and
mother-of-pearl at the top, shading into porphyry
veined with streaks of verd and jade�Fuji-San, the
despair of painters, the birthplace of the ancient
gods.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The aching beauty of it stung Barbara with a
tender, intolerable pang. The little fishing-villages
that presently came into sight, tucked into the clefts
of the shore, with gray dwellings, elfishly frail,
climbing the green slope behind them�the growing
rice in patches of cloudy gold on the hillsides�the
bluish shadows of bamboo groves�all touched her
with an incommunicable delight.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A shadow fell beside her and she turned. It was
her uncle. His clean-shaven face beamed at her over
his clerical collar.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Isn't it glorious?" she breathed. "It's better
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page4" id="page4" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
than champagne! It's like pins and needles in the
tips of your fingers! There's positively an odor in
the air like camelias. And did any one ever see such
colors?" She pointed to the shore dead-ahead, now
a serrated background of deep tones, swimming in
the infinite gold of the tropic afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bishop Randolph was a bachelor, past middle age,
ruddy and with eyes softened by habitual good-humor.
He was the son of a rector of a rich Virginian
parish, which on his father's death had sent
the son a unanimous call. He had answered, "No;
my place is in Japan," without consciousness of sacrifice.
For him, in the truest sense, the present
voyage was a homeward one.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Japan gets into the blood," he said musingly. "I
often think of the old lady who committed suicide
at Nikko. She left a letter which said: 'By favor
of the gods, I am too dishonorably old to hope to
revisit this jewel-glorious spot, so I prefer augustly
to remain here for ever!' I have had something of
the same feeling, sometimes. I remember yet the
first time I saw the coast. That was twenty-five
years ago. We watched it together�your father
and I�just as we two are doing now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked at him with sudden eagerness, for of
his own accord he had never before spoken to her
of her dead father. The latter had always seemed a
very real personage, but how little she knew about
him! The aunt who had brought her up�her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page5" id="page5" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
mother's sister�had never talked of him, and her
uncle she had seen but twice since she had been old
enough to wonder. But, little by little, gleaning a
fact here and there, she had constructed a slender
history of him. It told of mingled blood, a birthplace
on a Mediterranean island and a gipsy childhood.
There was a thin sheaf of yellowed manuscript
in her possession that had been left among her
mother's scanty papers, a fragment of an old diary
of his. Many leaves had been ruthlessly cut from it,
but in the pages that were left she had found bits
of flotsam: broken memory-pictures of his own
mother which had strangely touched her, of a bitter
youth in England and America overshadowed by
the haunting fear of blindness, of quests to West-Indian
cities, told in phrases that dripped liquid
gold and sunshine. The voyage to Japan had
been made on the same vessel that carried her
uncle, and they two had thus become comrades. The
latter had been an enthusiastic young missionary,
one of a few chosen spirits sent to defend a far field-casement
thrown forward by the batteries of Christendom.
His sister had come out to visit him and a
few months later had married his friend.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Such was the story, as Barbara knew it, of her
father and mother�a love chapter which had soon
closed with a far-away grave by the Inland Sea.
Her fancy had made of her father a pathetic figure.
As a child, she had dreamed of some day placing a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page6" id="page6" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
monument to his memory in the Japanese capital.
She possessed only one picture of him, a tiny profile
photograph which she wore always in a locket engraved
with her name. It showed a dark face, clean-shaven,
finely chiseled and passionate, with the
large, full eye of the dreamer. She had liked to
think it looked like the paintings of St. John. Perhaps
this thought had caused the projected monument
to take the form of a Christian chapel. From
a nebulous idea, the plan had become a bundle
of blue-prints, which she had sent to her uncle,
with the request that he purchase for her a suitable
site and begin the building. He had done this before
his visit to America and now the Chapel was completed,
save in one particular�the memorial window
of rich, stained-glass stowed at that moment in
the ship's hold. The bishop had not seen it. From
some feeling which she had not tried to analyze,
Barbara had said nothing to him of the Chapel's especial
significance. Now, however, at his unexpected
reference, the feeling frayed, and she told
him all of her plan.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He gazed at her a moment in a startled fashion,
then looked away, his hand shading his eyes. When
she finished there was a long pause which made her
wonder. She touched his arm.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You were very fond of father, weren't you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he said, in a tone oddly restrained.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page7" id="page7" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
"And was my mother with you when he fell in
love with her?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," and after a pause: "I married them."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Then they went to Nagasaki," she said softly,
"and there�he died. You weren't there then?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No," he answered in a low voice. His face was
still turned away, and she caught an unaccustomed
note of feeling in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He left her abruptly and began to pace up and
down the deck, while she stood watching the shoreline
sharpen, the tangled blur of harbor resolve
and shift into manifold detail. Shapeless dots had
become anchored ships, a black pencil a wharf, a
long yellow-gray streak a curved shore-front lined
with buildings, and the warm green blotch rising
behind it a foliaged hill pricked out with soft, gray
roofs. There was a rush of passengers to one side,
where from a brisk little tug, at whose peak floated
a flag bearing a blood-red sun, a handful of spick-and-span
Japanese officials were climbing the ship's
ladder.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At length the bishop spoke again at her elbow,
now in his usual voice: "What are you going to
do with that man, Barbara?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A faint flush rose in her cheek. "With what
man?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Austen Ware."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She shrugged her shoulders and laughed�a little
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page8" id="page8" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
uneasily. "What can one do with a man when he is
ten thousand miles away?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He's not the sort to give up a chase."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Even a wild-goose chase?" she countered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"When I was a boy in Virginia," he said with a
humorous eye, "I used to chase wild geese, and bag
'em, too."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bishop sauntered away, leaving a frown on
Barbara's brow. She had had a swift mental vision
of a cool, dark-bearded face and assured bearing
that the past year had made familiar. It was a
handsome face, if somewhat cold. Its owner was
rich, his standing was unquestioned. The fact that
he was ten years her senior had but made his attentions
the more flattering. He had had no inherited
fortune and had been no idler; for this she admired
him. If she had not thrilled to his declaration, so
far as liking went, she liked him. The week she left
New York he had intended a yachting trip to the
Mediterranean. When he told her, coolly enough,
that he should ask her again in Japan, she had
treated it as a jest, though knowing him quite capable
of meaning it. From every worldly standpoint
he was distinctly eligible. Every one who knew
them both confidently expected her to marry Ware.
Well, why not?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Yet to-day she did not ask herself the question
confidently. It belonged still to the limbo of the future�to
the convenient "some day" to which her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page9" id="page9" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
thought had always banished it. Since she had
grown she had never felt for any one the sentiment
she had dreamed of in that vivid girlhood of hers,
a something mixed of pride and joy, that a sound
or touch would thrill with a delight as keen as pain;
but unconsciously, perhaps, she had been clinging to
old romantic notions.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A passenger leaning near her was whistling
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Sally in our Alley</i> under his breath and a Japanese
steward was emptying over the side a vase of
wilted flowers. A breath of rose scent came to her,
mixed with a faint smell of tobacco, and these and
the whistled air awoke a sudden reminiscence. Her
gaze went past the clustered shipping, beyond the
gray line of buildings and the masses of foliage, and
swam into a tremulous June evening seven years
past.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She saw a wide campus of green sward studded
with stately elms festooned with electric lights that
glowed in the falling twilight. Scattered about
were groups of benches each with its freight
of dainty frocks, and on one of them she saw herself
sitting, a shy girl of sixteen, on her first visit to
a great university. Men went by in sober black
gown and flat mortar-boards, young, clean-shaven,
and boyish, with arms about one another's shoulders.
Here and there an orange "blazer" made a
vivid splash of color and groups in white-flannels
sprawled beneath the trees under the perfumed haze
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page10" id="page10" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
of briar-wood pipes that mingled with the near-by
scent of roses. From one of the balconies of the ivied
dormitories that faced the green came the mellow
tinkle of a mandolin and the sound of a clear tenor:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"Of all the girls that are so smart,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">There's none like pretty Sally.</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">She is the darling of my heart�"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The groups about her had fallen silent�only one
voice had said: "That's 'Duke' Daunt." Then the
melody suddenly broke queerly and stopped, and the
man who had spoken got up quickly and said: "I'm
going in. It's time to dress anyway." And somehow
his voice had seemed to break queerly, too.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Duke Daunt! The scene shifted into the next
day, when she had met him for a handful of delirious
moments. For how long afterward had he
remained her childish idol! Time had overlaid the
memory, but it started bright now at the sound of
that whistled tune.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her uncle's voice recalled her. He was handing
her his binoculars. She took them, chose a spot well
forward and glued her eyes to the glass.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A sigh of ecstasy came from her lips, for it
brought the land almost at arm's length�the stone
<i style="text-shadow: none;">hatoba</i> crowded with brown Japanese faces, pricked
out here and there by the white Panama hat or pith-helmet
of the foreigner; at one side a bouquet of gay
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page11" id="page11" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
muslin dresses and beribboned parasols flanked by
a phalanx of waiting <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>,�the little flotilla
of crimson sails at the yacht anchorage�the stately,
columned front of the club on the Bund with its cool
terrace of round tables�the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono'd</i> figures squatting
under the grotesquely bent pines along the
water-front, where a motor-car flashed like a brilliant
mailed beetle�farther away tiny shop-fronts
hung with waving figured blue and beyond them a
gray billowing of tiled roofs, and long, bright, yellow-chequered
streets sauntering toward a mass of
glowing green from which cherry blooms soared
like pink balloons. Arching over all the enormous
height of the spring-time blue, and the dreamy soft
witchery of the declining sun. It unfolded before her
like a panorama�all the basking, many-hued, polyglot,
half-tropical life�a colorful medley, queer and
mysterious!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Nearer, nearer yet, the ship drew on, till there
came to meet it two curved arms of breakwater, a
miniature lighthouse at each side. The captain on
the bridge lifted his hand, and a cheer rose from the
group of male passengers below him as the anchor-chain
snored through the hawse-holes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara lowered the glass from her eyes. The
slow swinging of the vessel to the anchor had
brought a dazzling bulk between her gaze and the
shore, perilously near. She saw it now in its proper
perspective�a trim steam yacht, painted white, with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page12" id="page12" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
a rakish air of speed and tautness, the sun glinting
from its polished brass fittings. It lay there, graceful
and light, a sharp, clean contrast to the gray and
yellow <i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i> and grotesque <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>, a disdainful
swan amid a noisy flock of teal and mallard.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Adjusting the focus Barbara looked. A man in
naval uniform who had boarded the ship at Quarantine
was pointing out the yacht to a passenger, and
Barbara caught crisp bits of sentences: "You see
the patches of green?�they're decorations for the
Squadron that's due to-morrow. Look just beyond
them. Prettiest craft I've ever seen east of the
Straits.... Came in this morning. Owner's in
Nara now, doing the temples.... Has a
younger brother who's been out here for a year, going
the pace.... They won't let private yachts
lie any closer in or they'd go high and dry on
empty champagne bottles."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara was feeling a strange sensation of familiarity.
Puzzled, she withdrew her gaze, then
looked once more.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly she dropped the glass with a startled
exclamation. "What are you going to do with that
man?"�her uncle's query seemed to echo satirically
about her. For the white yacht was Austen Ware's,
and there, on the gleaming bows, in polished golden
letters, was the name</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;">BARBARA</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chII" id="chII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER II<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">"THE ROOST"</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> day had been sluggish with the promise
of summer, but the failing afternoon had
brought a soft suspiration from the broad
bosom of the Pacific laden with a refreshing coolness.
Along the Bund, however, there was little stir.
A few blocks away the foreign dive-quarter was
drowsing, and only a single <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> twanged in Hep
Goon's saloon, where sailors of a dozen nationalities
spent their wages while in port. At the curbing,
under the telegraph poles, the chattering <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>
coolies squatted, playing <i style="text-shadow: none;">Go</i> with flat stones on a
square scratched with a pointed stick in the hard,
beaten ground. On the spotless mats behind their
paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> the curio-merchants sat on their gaudy
wadded cushions, while, over the glowing fire-bowls
of charcoal in the inner rooms, their wives cooked
the rice for the early evening meal. The office of
the Grand Hotel was quiet; only a handful of
loungers gossiped at the bar, and the last young
lady tourist had finished her flirtation on the terrace
and retired to the comfort of a stayless <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>. In
the deep foliage of the "Bluff" the slanting sunlight
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page14" id="page14" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
caught and quivered till the green mole seemed a
mighty beryl, and in its hedge-shaded lanes, dreamy
as those of an English village, the clear air was pungent
with tropic blooms.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On one of these fragrant byways, its front looking
out across the bay, stood a small bungalow
which bore over its gateway the dubious appellation
"The Roost." From its enclosed piazza, over which
a wistaria vine hung pale pendants, a twisted stair
led to the roof, half of which was flat. This space
was surrounded by a balustrade and shaded by a
rounded gaily striped awning. From this airy retreat
the water, far below, looked like a violet shawl
edged with shimmering quicksilver and embroidered
with fairy fishing <i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i> and <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>; and the subdued
voices of the street mingled, vague and undefined,
with a rich dank smell of foliage, that moved silently,
heavy with the odor of plum-blossoms, a
gliding ghost of perfume. Thin blue-and-white
Tientsin rugs and green wicker settees gave an impression
of coolness and comfort; a pair of ornate
temple brasses gleamed on a smoking-stand, and a
rich Satsuma bowl did duty for a tobacco jar.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Under the striped awning three men were
grouped about a miniature roulette table; a fourth,
middle-aged and of huge bulk, with a cynical, Semitic
face, from a wide arm-chair was lazily peering
through the fleecy curdle of a Turkish cigarette. A
fifth stood leaning against the balustrade, watching.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page15" id="page15" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
The last was tall, clean-cut and smooth-shaven,
with comely head well set on broad shoulders, and
gray eyes keen and alert. Possibly no one of the
foreign colony (where a Secretary of Embassy was
by no means a <i style="text-shadow: none;">rara avis</i>) was better liked than
Duke Daunt, even by those who never attempted
to be sufficiently familiar with him to call him by the
nickname, which a characteristic manner had earned
him in his salad days.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At intervals a player muttered an impatient exclamation
or gave a monosyllabic order to the stolid
Japanese servant who passed noiselessly, deftly replenishing
glasses. Through all ran the droning
buzz of bees in the wistaria, the recurrent rustle of
the metal wheel, the nervous click of the rolling
marble and the shuffle and thud of the ivory disks
on the green baize. All at once the marble blundered
into its compartment and one of the gamesters burst
into a boisterous laugh of triumph.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As the sudden discord jangled across the silence,
the big man in the arm-chair started half round, his
lips twitched and a spasm of something like fright
crossed his face. The glass at his elbow was empty,
but he raised it and drained air, while the ice in it
tinkled and clinked. He set it down and wiped his
lips with a half-furtive glance about him, but the
curious agitation had apparently been unnoted, and
presently his face had once more regained its speculative,
slightly sardonic expression.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page16" id="page16" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
Suddenly a distant gun boomed the hour of sunset.
At the same instant the marble ceased its erratic
career, the wheel stilled and the youngest of
the gaming trio and the master of the place�Philip
Ware, a graceful, shapely fellow of twenty-three,
with a flushed face and nervous manner�pushed
the scattered counters across the table with shaking
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My limit to-day," he said with sullen petulance,
and flipping the marble angrily into the garden below,
crossed to a table and poured out a brandy-and-soda.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt's gray eyes had been looking at him steadily,
a little curiously. He had known him seven
years before at college, though the other had been in
a lower class than himself. But those intervening
years had left their baleful marks. At home Phil
had stood only for loose habit, daring fad, and
flaunting mannerism�milestones of a career as
completely dissolute as a consistent disregard of
conventional moral thoroughfares could well make
it. To Yokohama he was rapidly coming to be, in
the eyes of the censorious, an example for well-meaning
youth to avoid, an incorrigible <i style="text-shadow: none;">flan�ur</i>, a
purposeless idler on the primrose paths.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Better luck next time," said one of the others
lightly. "Come along, Larry; we'll be off to the
club."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The older man rose to depart more deliberately,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page17" id="page17" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
his great size becoming apparent. He was framed
like a wrestler, abnormal width of shoulder and
massive head giving an effect of weight which contrasted
oddly with aquiline features in which was a
touch of the accipitrine, something ironic and sinister,
like a vulture. His eyes were dappled yellow
and deep-set and had a peculiar expression of cold,
untroubled regard. He crossed to the farther side
and looked down.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What a height!" he said. "The whole harbor is
laid out like a checker-board." He spoke in a tone
curiously dead and lacking in <i style="text-shadow: none;">timbre</i>. His English
was perfect, with a trace of accent.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pretty fair," assented Phil morosely. "It ought
to be a good place to view the Squadron, when it
comes in to-morrow morning. It must have cost the
Japanese navy department a pretty penny to build
those temporary wharves along the Bund. They
must be using a thousand incandescents! By the
decorations you'd think the Dreadnaughts were
Japan's long lost brothers, instead of battle-ships of
a country that's likely to have a row on with her almost
any minute. I wonder where they will anchor."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The yellowish eyes had been gazing with an odd,
intent glitter, and into the heavy, pallid face, turned
away, had sprung sharp, evil lines, that seemed the
shadows of some monstrous reflection on which the
mind had fed. Its sudden, wicked vitality was in
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page18" id="page18" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
strange contrast to the toneless voice, which now
said: "They will lie just opposite this point."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So far in?" The young man leaning on the
balustrade spoke interestedly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It seems as though from here one could almost
shoot a pea aboard any one of them."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You might send me up some sticks of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shimos�</i>,
Doctor," said Phil with satiric humor, "and I'll practise.
I'll begin by shying a few at this forsaken town;
it needs it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The big man smiled faintly as he withdrew his
eyes, and held out his hand to the remaining visitor.
The degrading lines had faded from his face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm distinctly glad to have seen you, Mr. Daunt,"
he said. "I've watched your trials with your a�roplane
more than once lately at the parade-ground.
I saw the elder Wright at Paris last year and I believe
your flight will prove as well sustained as his.
It's a pity you can't compete for some of the European
prizes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm afraid that would take me out of the amateur
class," was the answer. "It's purely an amusement
with me�a fad, if you like."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"A very useful one," said the other, "unless you
break your neck at it. I wonder we haven't met before
in Tokyo. I have an appointment to-night, by
the way, with your Ambassador. Come in to see
me soon," he said, turning to Phil. "I'm at home
most of the time. Come and dine with me again.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page19" id="page19" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
I've only an indifferent cook, as you have discovered,
I'm afraid, but my new boy Ishida can make a
famous cup of coffee and I can always promise you
a good cigar."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Doctor Bersonin's the real thing!" said Phil,
when the other had disappeared. "He's a scientist�the
biggest in his line�but he's no prig. He believes
in enjoying life. You ought to see his villa at
Kisaraz on the Chiba Road. He's worth a million,
they say, and he must make no end of money as a
government expert." He paused, then added: "You
seem mighty quiet to-night! How does he strike
you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt was silent. He had seen that strange look
that had shot across the expert's face�at the sound
of a laugh! He was wondering, too, what attraction
could exist between this middle-aged scientist
with his cold eyes and emotionless voice and Phil,
sparkling and irresponsible black-sheep and ne'er-do-well,
who thought of nothing but his own coarse
pleasures. Frequently, of late, he had seen them together,
at theater or tea-house, and once in Bersonin's
motor-car in Shiba Park in Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You don't like him! I can see that well
enough," went on Phil aggressively. "Why not?
He's a lot above any man <i style="text-shadow: none;">I</i> know, and I'm proud to
have him for a friend of mine."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There's no accounting for tastes," returned
Daunt dryly. "At any rate, I don't imagine it matters
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page20" id="page20" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
particularly whether I like Doctor Bersonin or
not. There's another thing that's more apropos."
He pointed to the decanter in the other's hands.
"You've had enough of that to-night, I should
think."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil reddened. "I've had no more than I can
carry, if it comes to that," he retorted. "And I
guess I'm able to take care of myself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt hesitated a moment. To-day's call had
been a part of his consistent effort, steadily growing
more irksome, to keep alive for the sake of the old
college name, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">quasi</i> friendship between them and
to invoke whatever influence he might once have
possessed.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm thinking of your brother," he said quietly.
"You say his yacht came into harbor from Kobe to-day.
He'll scarcely be more than a week in the
temple cities, and any train may bring him after
that. You'll want all the time you've got to
straighten out. You'll need to put your best foot
forward."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A look that was not pleasant shot across Phil's
face. "I suppose I shall," he said savagely. "A
pretty brother he is! He wrote me from home that
if he found I'd been playing, he'd cut his allowance
to me to twenty dollars a week. I'd like to knock
that smile of his down his throat�the cold-blooded
fish! <i style="text-shadow: none;">He</i> spends enough!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He's earned it, I understand," said Daunt.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page21" id="page21" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
"So will I, perhaps, after I've had my fling. I'm
in no hurry, and I won't take orders always from
him! I've had to knuckle down to him all my life,
and I'm precious tired of it, I can tell you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt's eyes had turned to the broad expanse below,
where the white sails of vagrant <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>
drifted. In the road he could hear the sharp tap-tap
of a blind <i style="text-shadow: none;">amma</i>�adept in the Japanese massage
which coaxes soreness from the body�as he passed
slowly along, feeling his way with his stick and
from time to time sounding on his metal flute his
characteristic double note. Across the moment's
silence the sound came clear and bird-like, very
shrill and sweet.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What business is it of his," Phil added, "if I
choose to stay out here in the East?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt withdrew his gaze. "Take his advice,
Phil," he said. "The East isn't doing you any
good. You're doing nothing but dissipate. And�it
doesn't pay."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil gave a short, sneering laugh. "Why
shouldn't I stay abroad if I can have more fun here
than I can at home?" he returned. "If I had my
way, I'd never want to see the United States again!
This country suits me at present. When I get tired,
I'll leave�if I can raise enough to get out of town."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A flush had risen to Daunt's forehead, but he
turned away without reply. At the stair, however,
he spoke again:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page22" id="page22" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
"Look here, Phil," he said, coming slowly back.
"Why not come up to Tokyo for a while? It's�quieter,
and it will be a change. I have a little
Japanese house in Aoyama that I leased as a place
to work on my Glider models, but I don't use it
now, and it's fairly well furnished. The caretaker
is an excellent cook, too." He took a key from its
ring and laid it on the table. "Let me leave this anyway�the
address is on the label�and do as you like
about it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil looked at him an instant with narrowing
eyes, then laughed. "Tokyo as a gentle sedative,
eh? And pastoral visitations every other day!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You needn't be afraid of that," replied Daunt.
"I'll not come to lecture you. I haven't set foot in
the place for a month, and probably shan't for a
month to come. Go up and try it, anyway. Drop the
Bund and the races for a little while and get a grip
on things!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil looked away. A sudden memory came to
him of a face he had seen in Tokyo�at one of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">matsuri</i> or ward-festivals�a girl's face, oval and
pensive and with a smile like a flash of sunlight.
Her <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> had been all of holiday colors, and he
had tried desperately to pick acquaintance, with poor
success. A second time he had seen her, on the
beach at Kamakura. Then she had worn a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
of rich brown, soft and clinging, and an <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i> stamped
with yellow maple leaves and fastened with a little
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page23" id="page23" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
silver clasp in the shape of a firefly. She was with
a party of girls bent on frolic; they had discarded
the white cleft <i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi</i> and clog and were splashing
through the surf bare-kneed. He could see yet the
foam on the perfect naked feet, and below the lifted
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> and red petticoat, the gleam of the white
skin that is the dream of Japanese women. A flush
crept over Phil's face as he remembered. He had
had better success that time. She had dropped her
swinging clog and he had rescued it, and won a
word of thanks and a smile from her dark eyes.
She herself had unbent little, but the girls with her
were full of frolic and the handsome foreigner was
an adventure. He had discovered that she spoke
English and lived in Tokyo, in the ward of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">matsuri</i>. But though he had strolled through that
district a score of times since, he had not seen her
again.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You're not a bad sort, Daunt," he said. "I don't
know but I�will."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Good," said Daunt. "I'll send a chit to my caretaker
the first thing in the morning, and I'll put your
name on the visitors' list at the Tokyo Club. Well,
I must be off."</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil saw him cross the fragrant close to the gate
with a growing sneer. Then he threw himself on a
chair and gazed moodily out across the deepening
haze to where, just inside the harbor breakwater,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page24" id="page24" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
lay the white yacht of whose coming Daunt had
spoken.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A bitter scowl was on his face. Far below, at a
little wharf, he could see a tiny red triangle; it
marked his sail-boat, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Fatted-Calf</i>, so christened
at a tea-house on the river where he and
other choice spirits maintained the club whose
<i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> suppers had become notorious. Japan, to his
way of life, had proven expensive. He had drawn
on every available resource and had borrowed more
than he liked to remember, but still his debts had
grown. And now, with the coming of the white
yacht, he saw a lowering danger to the allowance
on which he abjectly depended. He knew his brother
for one whom no plea could sway from a determination,
who on occasion could hew to the line with
merciless exactitude. Suppose he should cut off his
allowance altogether. An ugly passion stole over
his countenance. He sprang up, filled a glass from
the decanter and drank it thirstily. With the instant
glow of the liquor his mood relaxed. He
picked up the key from the table and stood thoughtfully
swinging it a moment by its wooden label.
Then he put it in his pocket and, looking at his
watch, caught up a straw hat and went briskly down
to the street.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He swung down the steep, twisting, ravine-like
road to the Bund with less of ill-humor. He had no
thought of the dark blue sky arching over, soft with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page25" id="page25" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
vapors like a smoke of gold, or of the glimpses of
the sea that came in sharp bursts of light between
the curving walls that towered on either side. He
sniffed the thick, Eastern smells as a cat sniffs catnip,
his eye searching the stream of brown, shouting
coolies and toiling <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, to linger on a satiny
oval face under a shining head-dress, or the powdered
cheek of a gold-brocaded <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> on her way
to some noble's feast.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the foot of the hill, stood a sign-board on
which was pasted a large bill in yellow:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">AT THE GAIETY THEATER</span></p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">LIMITED ENGAGEMENT OF</span></p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">THE POPULAR HARDMANN COMIC OPERA COMPANY</span></p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">WITH</span></p>
<p class="cnotmargin" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">MISS CISSY CLIFFORD</span></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He paused in front of this a moment, then passed
to the Bund. At its upper end, near the hotel front,
great floating wharves had been built out into the
water. They were gaily trimmed with bunting and
electric lights in geometrical designs, and were
flanked by arches covered with twigs of ground-pine.
A small army of workmen were still busied
on them, for the European Squadron in whose
honor they had been erected would arrive at dawn
the next morning. Just beyond the arches, under a
row of twisted pines, were a number of park benches,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page26" id="page26" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
and from one of these a girl with a beribboned
parasol greeted him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You're a half hour late, Phil," she complained.
"I've been waiting here till I'm tired to death." She
made place for him with a rustle of flounces. She
was showily dressed, her cheeks bore the marks of
habitual grease-paint and the fingers of one over-ringed
hand were slightly yellowed from cigarette
smoke.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Hello, Cissy," he said carelessly, and sat down
beside her. In his mind was still the picture of that
oval Japanese face suffused with pink, those pretty
bare feet splashing through the foam, and he looked
sidewise at his companion with an instant's sullen
distaste.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I had another row with the manager to-day,"
she continued. "I told him he must think his company
was a kindergarten!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Trust you to set him right in that," he answered
satirically.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My word!" she exclaimed. "How glum you are
to-day! Same old poverty, I suppose." She rose
and shook out her skirts. "Come," she said.
"There's no play to-night. I'm in for a lark. Let's
go to the Jewel-Fountain Tea-House. They've got
a new juggler there."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">In</span> the first touch of the shore, where the Ambassador's
pretty daughter waited, Barbara's
problem had been swept away. Patricia had
rushed to meet her, embraced her, with a moist,
ecstatic kiss on her cheek, rescued the bishop from
his ordeal of hand-shaking and carried him off
to find their trunks, leaving Barbara borne down by
a Babel of sound and scent whose newness made her
breathless, and to whose manifold sensations she
was as keenly alive as a photographic plate to color.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A half-dozen gnarled, unshaven porters in excessively
shabby jackets and straw sandals carried her
hand-baggage into the hideously modern, red-brick
custom-house, over whose entrance a huge golden
conventionalized chrysanthemum shone in the sunlight,
and as she watched them, a dapper youth in
European dress, with a shining brown derby, a
bright purple neck-tie, a silver-mounted cane and
teeth eloquent of gold bridge-work, slid into her
hand a card whose type proclaimed that Mr. Y.
Nakajima "did the guiding for foreign ladies and
gentlemans." The air was fragrant with the mild
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page28" id="page28" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
aroma from tiny Japanese pipes and a-flutter with
moving fans. A group of elderly men in hot frock-coats
and tiles of not too modern vintage were welcoming
a returning official, and sedate gentlemen in
sad-colored <i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i> and spotless cleft foot-wear,
bowed double in stately ceremonial, with the sucking-in
of breath which in the old-fashioned Japanese
etiquette means "respectful awe bordering on
terror."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had found herself singularly conscious
of a feeling of universal good-nature. It came to
her even in the posture of the resting coolies,
stretched at the side of the quay, lazily sunning
themselves, with whiffs of the omnipresent little
pipe, and in the faces of the bare-legged <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>
men, with round hats like bobbing mushrooms,
arms and chests glistening with sweat, and thin
towels printed in black and blue designs tucked in
their girdles. She smiled at them, and they smiled
back at her with that unvarying smile which the
Japanese of every caste wears to wedding and to
funeral. She even caught herself patting the tonsured
head of a preternaturally solemn baby
swaddled in a variegated <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>  and strapped to the
back of a five-year-old boy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> ride to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">stenshun</i> (for so the
Japanese has adapted the English word "station")
was a moving panorama of strange high lights and
shades, of savory odors from bake-ovens, of open
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page29" id="page29" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
shop-fronts hung with gaudy figured crape, or piled
with saffron <i style="text-shadow: none;">biwa</i>, warty purple melons, ebony eggplant,
shriveled yellow peppers and red Hokkaido
apples, of weighted carts drawn by chanting half-naked
coolies, and swiftly gliding victorias of Europeans.
From a hundred houses in the long, narrow
streets hung huge gilded sign-boards, painted with
idiographs of black and red. At intervals the tall
stone front of a foreign business building looked
down on its neighbors, or a tea-house towered
three stories high, showing gay little verandas on
which stood pots of flowers and dwarf trees; between
were smaller houses of frame and of cement,
and thick-walled <i style="text-shadow: none;">go-downs</i> for storing goods against
fire.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Here and there, from behind a gateway of unpainted
wood, showing a delicate grain, a pine
thrust up its needled clump of green, or a cherry-tree
flung its pink pyrotechnics against the sky's
flood of dimming blue and gold. At a crossing
a deformed beggar with distorted face and the
featureless look of the leper, waved a crutch and
wheedled from the roadside, and a child in dun-colored
rags, unbelievably agile and dirty, ran
ahead of Barbara's <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, prostrating himself
again and again in the dust, holding out grimy
hands and whining for a <i style="text-shadow: none;">sen</i>. In the side streets
Barbara could catch glimpses of bare-breasted
women sitting in shop doors nursing babies, and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page30" id="page30" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
children of a larger growth playing Japanese hopscotch
or tossing "diavolo," the latest foreign toy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When the <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> set them down at the station
she felt bewildered, yet full of exhilaration. As
they drew up at its stone front, a porter with red
cap and brass buttons emerged and began to ring a
heavy bell, swinging it back and forth in both
hands. The bishop bought their tickets at a little
barred window bearing over it the sign: "Your
baggages will be sent freely in every direction."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Making their way along the platform, crowded
with Japanese, mostly in native dress, and filled
with the aroma of cigarettes and the thin ringing
of innumerable wooden clogs on stone flags, Barbara
was conscious for the first time of a studious
surveillance. A young Japanese passed her carrying
his bent and wizened mother on his back; the old
woman, clutching him tightly about the neck, turned
her shaven head to watch. Children in startling
rainbow tinted <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> stared from the platform
with round, serious eyes. A peasant woman, with
teeth brilliantly blackened, peered from a car window,
and a group of young men turned bodily
and regarded her with gravely observant gaze, in a
prolonged, unwinking scrutiny that seemed as innocent
of courtesy as of any intent to offend. In European
cities she had felt the gaze of other races, but
this was different. It was not the curious study of
a phenomenon, of an enduring puzzle of far origins,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page31" id="page31" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
nor the expression of the ignorant, vacantly amused
by what they do not understand; it was a
deeper look of inner placidity, that held no wonder
and no awe, and somehow suggested thoughts as
ancient as the world. A curious sense began to
possess Barbara of having left behind her all familiar
every-day things, of being face to face with
some new wonder, some brooding mystery which
she could not grasp.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They entered the car just behind an ample lady
who had been among the ship's passengers�a good-natured,
voluble Cook's tourist who, the second day
out, had confided to Barbara her certainty of an invitation
to the Imperial Cherry-Blossom party, as
her husband had "a friend in the litigation." She
wore a painted-muslin, and the husband of influential
acquaintance and substantial, red-bearded person
showed now a gleaming expanse of white waistcoat
crossed by a gold watch-chain that might have restrained
a tiger. The lady nodded and smiled beamingly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Isn't it all perfectly splendid!" she cried.
"There was a baby on the platform that was too
<i style="text-shadow: none;">sweet</i>!�for all the world like the Japanese dolls we
buy at home, with their hair shingled and a little
round spot shaved right in the crown! My husband
tried to give it a silver dollar, but the mother just
smiled and bowed and went away and left it lying
on the bench." She found a seat and fanned herself
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page32" id="page32" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
vigorously with a handkerchief. "I just thought I
never <i style="text-shadow: none;">would</i> get through that car door," she added.
"It's only two feet across!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The road was narrow gage and the seats ran
the length of the car on either side. Hardly had its
occupants settled themselves when, to the shrill
piping of a horn, the train started.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Goodness, this is a relief!" sighed Patricia, as
the bishop opened the first Japanese newspaper he
had seen for many months. "I hate <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>�they're
such unsociable things! I haven't said ten
words to you, Barbara, and I've got oceans to talk
about. But I'll be merciful till I get you home.
What a good-looking youth that is in the corner!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The young man referred to had a light skin and
long, almond-shaped eyes. He wore a suit of gray
merino underwear, and between the end of the
drawers and the white, cleft sock, an inch of polished
skin was visible. His hat was a modish felt.
His <i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i>, which bore a woven crest on breast and
sleeves, swung jauntily open and above his left ear
was coquettishly disposed an unlighted cigarette.
Next him, under a brass rack piled with bright-patterned
carpet-bags, an old lady in dove-colored silk
was placidly inflating a rubber air-cushion. Her
face had an artificial delicacy of <i style="text-shadow: none;">nuance</i> that was a
triumph of rice-powder and rouge. Beside her was
a girl of perhaps eighteen, in a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of dark blue
and an <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i> of gold brocade. The latter wore white
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page33" id="page33" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
silk "mits" with bright metal trimming and on one
slender finger was a diamond ring. Her hands were
delicately artistic and expressive, and her complexion
as soft as the white wing of a miller. She
gazed steadfastly away, but now and then her sloe-black
eyes returned to study Barbara's foreign
gown and hat with surreptitious attention.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What complexions!" whispered Patricia. "The
old lady made hers this morning, sitting flat on a
white mat in front of a camphor-wood dressing-chest
about two feet high, with twenty drawers and
a round steel mirror on top. It beats a hare's-foot,
doesn't it! The daughter's is natural. If I had
been born with a skin like that, it would have
changed my whole disposition!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Having settled her air-cushion, the old lady drew
from her girdle a lacquer case and produced a pipe�a
thin reed with a tiny silver bowl at its end. A flat
box yielded a pinch of tobacco as fine as snuff. This
she rolled between her fingers into a ball the size of
a small pea, placed it carefully in the bowl and began
to smoke. Each puff she inhaled with a lingering
inspiration and emitted it slowly, in a thin
curdled cloud, from her nostrils. Three puffs, and
the tiny coal was exhausted. She tapped the pipe
gently against the edge of the seat, put it back into
the case and replaced the latter in her girdle. Then,
tucking up her feet under her on the plush seat, she
turned her back to the aisle and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page34" id="page34" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
Three students in the uniform of some lower
school with foreign jackets of blue-black cloth set
off with brass buttons, sat in a row on the opposite
side. Each had a cap like a cadet's, with a gilt
cherry-blossom on its front, and all watched Barbara
movelessly. The man nearest her wore a
round straw hat and horn spectacles. He was reading
a vernacular newspaper, intoning under his
breath with a monotonous sing-song, like the
humming of a bumblebee. Between them a little boy
sat on the edge of the seat, his clogs hanging from
the thong between his bare toes, the sleeves of his
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> bulging with bundles. He stared as if hypnotized
at a curl of Barbara's bronze hair which lay
against the cushion. Once he stretched out a hand
furtively to touch it, but drew it back hastily.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"If I could only talk to him!" Barbara exclaimed.
"I want to know the language. Tell me, Patsy�how
long did it take you to learn?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I?" cried Patricia in comical amazement. "Heavens
and earth, <i style="text-shadow: none;">I</i> haven't learned it! I only know
enough to badger the servants. You have to turn
yourself inside out to think Japanese, and then stand
on your head to talk it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Never mind, Barbara," said the bishop, looking
up from his newspaper. "You can learn it if you insist
on it. Haru would be a capital teacher�bless
my soul, I believe I forgot to tell you about her!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Who is Haru?" asked Barbara.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page35" id="page35" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
"She's a young Japanese girl, the daughter of
the old <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i> who sold us the land for the
Chapel. The family is a fine old one, but of frayed
fortune. I was greatly interested in her, chiefly,
perhaps, because she is a Christian. She became so
with her father's consent, though he is a Buddhist.
She isn't of the servant class, of course, but I
thought�if you liked�she would make an ideal
companion for you while you are learning Tokyo."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I know Haru," said Patricia. "She's a dear!
She's as pretty as a picture, and her English is too
quaint!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It would be lovely to have her," Barbara
answered. "You're a very thoughtful man, Uncle
Arthur. Are you sure she'll want to?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'll send her a note and ask her to come to you
at the Embassy this evening. Then�all aboard for
the Japanese lessons!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No such wisdom for me, thank you," said
Patricia. "I prefer to take mine in through the
pores. All the Japanese officials speak English anyway,
just as much as the diplomatic corps. By the
way, there's Count Voynich, the Servian <i style="text-shadow: none;">Charg�</i>."
She nodded toward the farther end of the carriage
where a bored-looking European plaintively regarded
the landscape through a monocle. "He's
nice," she added reflectively, "but he's a dyspeptic.
I caught him one night at a dinner dropping a capsule
into his soup. He has a cabinet with three
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page36" id="page36" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
hundred Japanese <i style="text-shadow: none;">nets'k�s</i>�they're the little ivory
carvings on the strings of tobacco-pouches. He
didn't speak to me for a month once because I said it
looked like a dental exhibition. Almost every secretary
has a fad, and that's his. Ours has an a�roplane.
He practises on it nearly every day on the
parade-ground. The pudgy woman in the other
corner with a cockatoo in her hat is Mrs. Sturgis,
the wife of the big exporter. She wears red French
heels and calls her husband 'papa'."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's laughter was infectious. It caught the
bishop. It reflected itself even on the demure face
of the Japanese girl, and the serious youths opposite
giggled openly in sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I do envy you your first impressions!" exclaimed
Patricia. "I've been here so long that I've
forgotten mine. It seems perfectly natural now for
people to live in houses made of bird-cages and paper
napkins, and travel about in grown-up baby-buggies,
and to see men walking around with bare legs and
oil-skin umbrellas. It's like the sea-shore at home, I
suppose�you get used to it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The train had stopped at a suburb and guards
went by proclaiming its name in a musical guttural,
their voices dwelling insistently on the long-drawn,
last syllable. The next carriage was a third-class
one with bare floors and wooden benches, set crosswise.
Through the opened door Barbara could see
its crowd of brown faces, keen and saturnine. On
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page37" id="page37" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
its front seat a heavy-featured, lumpish coolie
woman was nursing a three-year-old baby, holding
it to her bared breast with red and roughened
hands. Just outside the station's white-washed
fence, a clump of factory chimneys spouted pitchy
smoke into the dimming sky, and the descending
sun glistened from a monster gas-tank. Farther
away, beyond clipped hedges, lay thatched roofs,
looking as soft as mole-skin, with wild flowers
growing on the ridges, and bamboo clumps soaring
above them, like pale green ostrich-feathers
yellow at the tips. Through the open window came
the treble note of a girl singing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A man passed hastily through the carriage leaving
a trail of small pamphlets bound in green paper
with gold lettering�an advertisement of a health
resort, printed in English for the tourist. Barbara
opened one curiously. She looked up with a merry
eye.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Here's a paragraph for you, Uncle Arthur," she
said. "Listen:</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"'This place has other modern monuments, first
and second-class hotels and many sea-scapes. In
one quarter are a number of missionaries, but they
can easily be avoided.'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Do let us credit that to difficulties of the language,"
he protested. "I'm sure that must have
been meant complimentarily."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page38" id="page38" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
"But what a contradiction!" put in Patricia
wickedly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well," he retorted. "My baker has a sign on
his wagon, 'The biggest loafer in Tokyo.' He
means that well, too."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A shrill whistle, a slamming of doors, and now
the gray roofs fell away. On one side the steel
road all but dipped in the bay. Wild ducks drew
startled wakes across the rippleless lagoon. On a
sand-bar a flock of gray and white gulls disported,
looking at a distance like pied bathers; and about an
anchored fishing boat, a dozen naked urchins were
splashing with shrill cries. Far across the inlet,
hazy, vapory, visionary, Barbara could make out a
farther shore, an outline in violets and opalines,
coifed with lilac cloud, and in the mid-azure a high-pooped
<i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i> swam by, a shape of misty gold, palely
drawn in wan, blue light.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the other side the train was rounding grassy
hills, terraced to the very tops. Laid against their
steep sides, or standing upright on wooden framework,
were occasional huge advertisements in red
or white�Chinese characters or pictures�while
flowering camelia trees and small green-yellow
shrubs drew lengthening blue shadows. A high
tressle spanned acres of orchard where continuous
trellis made a carpet of growing fruit, across which
Barbara saw far away the bold outline of bluish
hills.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page39" id="page39" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
They were crossing flooded rice-fields now, like
gigantic crazy checker-boards, and the air was
musical with the low, chirring chorus of frogs.
Shades of orange light played over the marshes,
bars of rape braided them with vivid yellow, and on
the narrow, curving partitions between the burnished
squares, round stacks of garnered straw
stood like crawfish chimneys. Amid them peasants
worked with broad-bladed mattocks, knee-deep in
mud. They were blue clad, with white cloths bound
about their heads, and some had sashes of crimson.
Here and there, naked to the thighs, a boy trod a
water-wheel between the terraced levels. At intervals
a refractory rock-hillock served as excuse for a
single twisted pine-tree shading a carved tablet to
some <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> divinity, or a steep bluff sheltered a
tiny shrine of unpainted wood; and all along the
way, shining canals drew silver ribbons through the
paddy-fields, and little arrowy flights of birds darted
hither and thither.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Occasionally they passed small, neat stations,
each with its white sign-boards bearing long liquid
names in English, and queer Japanese characters.
Opposite one, on a sloping hill that was a mass of
deep glowing green, Patricia pointed out the peaked
roofs of a cluster of temples, the shrine of some century-dead
Buddhist saint. Barbara began to realize
that these fields through which this modern train
was gliding were old Japan, that in those blue hills
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page40" id="page40" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
had been nurtured the ancient legends she had read,
of famous two-sworded <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i>, of swaggering
bandits and pleasure-loving <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i>, and of tea-house
<i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> who danced their way into <i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyo's</i>
palaces. The spell of the land, whose sheer beauty
had thrilled her on the ship, drew her closer with
the threads of memories almost forgotten.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Its contrasts were wonderful. They spoke of
primary and unmixed emotions, that lisped themselves
through the fading golden sunlight, the
moist, dreamy air, the graceful outlines of roof and
tree. In the west the sun was declining toward a
range of hills jagged as the teeth of a bear. Their
tops were pale as cloud and their bases melted into
an ebony line of forest. The plain below was a
winey purple, with slashes of red earth gorges like
fresh wounds, and one side had the cloudy color of
raspberries crushed in curdled milk. The farther
range seemed a part of a far-off painted curtain,
tinted in pastels, and high above a milky cloud
floated, curling like a lace scarf about the opal crest
of Fuji, mysteriously blue and dim as an Arctic
summer sea.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara glimpsed it, the very spirit of beauty, between
the whirling shadows of pine and camphor
trees, between tiled walls guarding thatched temples,
flights of gray pigeons and spurts of pink
cherry-blossom. As she leaned out, and the pines
bowed rhythmically, and the water-wheels turned
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page41" id="page41" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
in the furrows, and the yellow-green of the bamboo,
the purple-indigo of the hills and the golden-pink
of the cherries lifting, above the hedges, went by
like raveling skeins of a tapestry�that majestic
Presence, ghostly and splendid above the wild contour
of hill and mountain, seemed to call to her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And across the gorgeous landscape, rejoicing
from every rift and crevice of its moist soil, in its
colors of rich red earth and green foliage, in the
grace and vigor of its springing, resilient bamboo
groves and the cardinal pride of its flowering
camelias, Barbara's heart answered the call.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page42" id="page42" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chIV" id="chIV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER IV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">UNDER THE RED SUNSET</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> slowing of the train awoke Barbara from
her reverie. The three boy students got out,
casting sidelong glances at her. More Japanese
entered, and two foreigners�a bright-faced
girl on the arm of a keen-eyed, soldierly man with
bristling white hair, a mustache like a walrus, and
a military button. The girl's hands were full of
cherry-branches, whose bunches of double blossoms,
incredibly thick and heavy, filled the car with a delicate
fragrance. The bishop folded his newspaper
and put it into his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he did so the owner of the expansive waistcoat
leaned across the aisle and addressed him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Say, my friend," he said, "you've lived out
here some time, I understand."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," the bishop replied. "Twenty-five years."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, I take it, then, you ought to know this
country right down to the ground; and if you don't
mind, I'd like to ask a question or two."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Do," said the bishop. "I'll be glad to answer
if I can."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page43" id="page43" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
The other got up and took a seat opposite. "You
see," he pursued confidentially, "I came on this
trip just for a rest and to settle the bills for the
curios my wife"�he indicated the lady, who had
now moved up beside him�"thinks she'd like to
look at back home. But I've been getting interested
by the minute. It's quite some time since I went to
school, and I guess there hadn't so much happened
then to Japan. I wish you'd run down the scale for
me�just to hit the high places. Now there was a
big rumpus here, I remember, at the time of our
Civil War. They chose a new Emperor, didn't
they?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No. The dynasty has been unbroken for two
thousand years."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Two thousand years!" cried the lady. "Why,
that's before Christ!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"When our ancestors, Martha, were painting
themselves up in yellow ochre and carrying clubs�what
was the row about, then?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was something like this. To go back a little,
the Emperor was always the nominal ruler and
spiritual head, but the temporal power was administered
by a self-decreed Viceroy called the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i>.
Japan was a closed country and only a little trading
was allowed in certain ports."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His questioner nodded. The girl beside the white-haired
old soldier had touched the latter's sleeve,
and both were listening attentively. "Then Perry
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page44" id="page44" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
came along and kicked open the gate. Bombarded
'em, didn't he?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bishop's eyes twinkled. "Only with gifts.
He brought a small printing-press, a toy telegraph
line and a miniature locomotive and railroad track.
He set up these on the beach and showed the officials
whom the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun's</i> government sent to treat with
him, how they worked. In the end he made them
understand the immense value of the scientific advancement
of the western world. The visit was an
eye-opener, and the wiser Japanese realized that the
nation couldn't exist under the old <i style="text-shadow: none;">r�gime</i> any
longer. It must make general treaties and adopt
new ideas. Some, on the other hand, wanted things
to stay as they were."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pulling both ways, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. At length the progressists decided on a
sweeping measure. Under the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogunate</i>, the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyos</i> (they were the great landed nobles) had
been in a continual state of suppressed insurrection."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Some wouldn't knuckle down to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i>, I
suppose."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Exactly. There was no national rallying-point.
But they all alike revered their Emperor. In all the
bloody civil wars of a thousand years�and the
Japanese were always fighting, like Europe in the
Middle Ages�no <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i> ever laid violent hands
on the Emperor. He was half divine, you see,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page45" id="page45" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
descended from the ancient gods, a living link between
them and modern men. So now they proposed
to give him complete temporal power, make
him ruler in fact, and abolish the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogunate</i> entirely."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Phew! And the big <i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyos</i> came into line on
the proposition?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"They poured out their blood and their money
like water for the new cause. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i> himself
voluntarily relinquished his power and retired to private
life."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Splendid!" said the stranger, and the girl clapped
her gloved hands. "So that was the 'Restoration,'
the beginning of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Meiji</i>, whatever that may mean?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The 'Era of Enlightenment.' The present Emperor,
Mutsuhito, was a boy of sixteen then. They
brought him here to Yedo, and renamed it
Tokyo��"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And proceeded to get reeling drunk on western
notions," said the man with the military button,
smiling grimly. "I was out here in the Seventies."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"True, sir," assented the bishop. "It was so, for
a time. And the opposition took refuge in riot,
assassination, and suicide. But gradually Japan
worked the modernization scheme out. She sent her
young statesmen to Europe and America to study
western systems of education, jurisprudence and
art. She hired an army of experts from all over the
world. She sent her cleverest lads to foreign universities.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page46" id="page46" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
In the end she chose what seemed to her
the best from all. Her military ideas come from
Germany and her railroad cars from the town of
Pullman, Illinois. When the best didn't suit her,
she invented a system of her own, as she has done
with wireless telegraphy."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So!" said the other. "I'm greatly obliged to
you, sir. I've read plenty in the newspapers, but I
never had it put so plain. It strikes me," he added
to the old soldier, "that a nation plucky enough to
do this in fifty years, in fifty more will make some
other nations get a move on." He brought a big fist
smashing down in an open palm. "And, by gad!
the Japanese deserve all they get! When we go
back I guess me and Martha won't march in any
anti-Jap torch-light processions, anyway!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The fields were gone now. The train was rumbling
along a canal teeming with laden <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>,
level with the paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> of frail-looking houses on
its opposite bank. Beyond lay a sea of roofs, swelling
gray billows of tiling spotted with green foam,
from which steel factory chimneys lifted like the
black masts of sunken ships. A leafy hill of cryptomeria
rose near-by, and an octagonal stone tower
peeped above its foliage. Crows were circling about
it, black dots against the bronze. The train was
entering Tokyo.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A door slammed sharply. From the forward
smoking carriage a man had entered. He was an
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page47" id="page47" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
European and Barbara was struck at once by his
great size and the absence of color in his leaden face.
The bored-looking diplomatist in the corner gathered
himself hastily into a bow, which the other acknowledged
abstractedly. Seemingly he had been
occupied in some intent speculation which spread a
kind of glaze over his sharp features. A book
drooped carelessly from his heavy fingers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is Doctor Bersonin," said the bishop, as the
girls collected their wraps. "He came just before
I left, last fall. He is the government expert, and
is supposed to be one of the greatest living authorities
on explosives."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, yes," said Patricia, "I know. He invented
a dynamo or a torpedo, or something. I saw him
once at a reception; he had a foreign decoration as
big as a dinner-plate."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The big man made his way slowly along the aisle
and, still absorbed, took a dust-coat from a rack.
As he ponderously drew it on, the daylight was
suddenly eclipsed, and the rumbling re�choed from
metal roofing. They were in Shimbashi Station.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Isn't he simply odious!" whispered Patricia, as
the expert stepped before them on to the long,
dusky, asphalt platform. "His eyes are like a cat's
and his hands look as if they wanted to crawl, like
big white spiders! There is the Embassy <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i>," she
said suddenly, pointing over the turnstile, where
stood a Japanese boy in a wide-winged <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page48" id="page48" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
tea-colored pongee with crimson facings and a crimson
mushroom hat. "The carriage is just outside.
You'll come, too, of course, Bishop," she added.
"Father will expect you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He shook his head and motioned toward a dense
assemblage comprising a half dozen of his own race
in clerical black, and a half hundred <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono'd</i>
Japanese, whose faces seemed one composite smile
of welcome. "There is a part of my flock," he said.
"There will be a jubilation at my bachelor palace
to-night. I shall see you to-morrow, I hope."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They watched him for a moment, the center of a
ceremonious ring of bowing figures, then passed
through the station to the steps where the carriage
waited.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The station debouched on to a broad open square
bordered with canals and lined with ranks of <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>,
some of which had small red flags with the
name of a hotel in white letters, in English. The
space was gray and dusty; pedestrians dotted it and
across it a bent and sweating street-sprinkler hauled
his ugly trickling cart, chanting in a half-tone as he
went. A little distance away Barbara caught a
glimpse of a busy paved street, lined with ambitious
glass shop-fronts and with a double line of clanging
trolley-cars passing to and fro beneath a maze of telegraph
wires seemingly as fine as pack-thread. Her
nostrils twitched with strange odors�from stagnant
moats of sticky, black mud, from panniers of dressed
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page49" id="page49" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
fish, from the rice-powder and pomade of women's
toilets�all the scents bred in swarming streets by
a glowing tropic sun.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At one side waited a handful of foreign carriages.
All the drivers of these wore the loose, flapping
liveries and the round hats of green or crimson or
blue. "They are Embassy turn-outs," explained
Patricia. "Each one has its color, you see. Ours
is red and you can see it farthest." As they took
their seats an open victoria rolled up, with cobalt-blue
wheels, and a <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i> with a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of dark cloth
trimmed with wide strips of the same hue ran ahead,
clearing the way with raucous cries. "There goes the
Bulgarian Minister's wife," said Patricia. "She's
got the finest pearls in Tokyo."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A hundred yards from the entrance the Embassy
carriage halted abruptly and Barbara caught her
companion's arm with a low exclamation. At the
side of the square, seated or reclining on the ground
was a body of perhaps eighty men dressed in a
deadly brownish-yellow, the hue of iron-rust, with
coarse hats and rough straw sandals. They were
disposed in lines, a handcuff was on each left wrist,
and a thin, rattling iron chain linked all together.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"They are convicts," said Patricia; "on their way
to the copper mines, I imagine. They will move
presently and we can pass."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the head of the melancholy platoon stood an
officer in dark blue cloth uniform and clumsy shoes,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page50" id="page50" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
a sword by his side. He stood motionless as an
idol, his sparse mustaches waxed, his visored cap
set square on his crisp, black hair, his bronze face
impassive. The prisoners looked on stolidly at the
stir of the station, the flying <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, the crowded
<i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i> in the canal, and the noisy trolley-cars passing
near-by. Some talked in low tones and pointed
here and there, with furtive glances at the officer.
Barbara noted their different expressions, some
stolid, low-browed and featureless, some with side-looks
of sharper cunning, all touched with oriental
apathy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A bell now began to clamor in the train-shed and
there came the rasping hoot of an engine. The
officer turned, gave a sharp order, and the prisoners
rose, with light clanking of their chains. Another
order, and they moved, in double lines of
single file, into the station.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Patricia heaved a sigh of relief as the halted
traffic started. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hyaku</i>, Tucker," she called to the
driver. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hyaku</i> means quickly," she explained aside.
"His name is Taka, but I call him Tucker because
it's easier to remember."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As they rolled swiftly on, through the wondrous
panorama of teeming Tokyo streets, the sun hung,
an elongated globe of deep orange-crimson, streaked
with little whips of rosy cloud. Beneath it the
mountains lay like coiled, purple dragons, indolent
and surfeited. One star twinkled palely in the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page51" id="page51" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;51]</span>
lemon-colored sky. Yet now to Barbara the splendor
of color seemed tragic, the poured-out beauty
but a veil, behind which moved, old and apish and
gray, the familiar passions of the world. Before
her eyes were flowing and mingling a thousand
strands of orient life, yet she saw only the red light
glowing on the stone entrance of Shimbashi, with
those hideous saffron jackets filing perpetually into
its yawning mouth, like unholy spectres in a dream.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page52" id="page52" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chV" id="chV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER V<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE MAKER OF BUDDHAS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> setting sun poured a flood of wine-colored
light over Reinanzaka�the "Hill-of-the-Spirit"�whose
long slope rose behind
the American Embassy, whither the Dandridge
victoria was rolling. It was a long leafy ridge stippled
with drab walls of noble Japanese houses, and
striped with narrow streets of the humble; one of
the many green knolls that, rising above the gray
roofs, make the Japanese capital seem an endless
succession of teeming village and restful grove.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Along its crest ran a lane bordered with thorn
hedges. A little way inside this stood a huge stone
<i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i>, facing a square, ornamented gateway, shaded
by cryptomerias. The latter was heavily but chastely
carved, and on its ceiling was a painting, in
green and white on a gold-leaf ground, of Kwan-on,
the All-Pitying. From the gate one looked down
across the declivity, where in a walled compound,
the rambling buildings of the Embassy showed pallidly
amid green foliage. Beyond this were sections
of trafficking streets, and still farther a narrow,
white road climbed a hill toward a military barracks�a
blur of dull, terra-cotta red. In the dying
afternoon the lane had an air of placid aloofness.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page53" id="page53" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
Somewhere in a thoroughfare below a trolley
bell sounded, an impudent note of haste and change
in a symphony of the intransmutable. Over all was
the scent of cherry-blossoms and a faint musk-like
odor of incense.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From the gate a mossy pavement, shaded by
sacred <i style="text-shadow: none;">mochi</i> trees, led to a Buddhist temple-front of
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Mon-to</i> sect, before which a flock of fluttering
gray-and-white pigeons were pecking grains of rice
scattered by a priest, who stood on its upper step,
watching them through placid, gold-rimmed spectacles.
He wore a long green robe, a stole of gold
brocade was around his neck, and his face was
seamed with the lines of life's receding tides. At one
side of the pavement, worn and grooved by centuries
of worshiping feet, was a square stone font and on
the other side a graceful bell-tower of red lacquer.
Back of this stood a forest of tall bronze lanterns,
and beyond them a graveyard, an acre thick with
standing stone tablets of quaint, squarish shape, chiseled
with deep-cut idiographs. Nearer the graveyard,
overshadowed by the greater bulk of the temple,
was a long, low nunnery, with clumps of flowers
about it. Through its bamboo lattices one caught
glimpses of women's figures, clad in slate-color, of
placid faces and boyishly shaven heads. About the
yard a few little children were playing and a mother,
with a baby on her back, looked smilingly on.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The space where the priest stood was connected
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page54" id="page54" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
by a small, curved, elevated bridge with another
temple structure standing on the right of the yard,
evidently used as a private residence. This was
more ornate, far older and touched with decay. Its
porch was arcaded, set with oval windows and hung
with bronze lanterns green from age. Its entrance
doors were beautifully carved, paneled with endless
designs in dull colors, and bordered with great gold-lacquer
peonies laid on a background of green and
vermilion. From their corners jutted snarling heads
of grotesque lions and on either side stood gigantic
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ni-O</i>�glowering demon-guardians of sacred
thresholds. Through the straight-boled trees that
grew close about it, came transient gleams of a
hedged garden, of burnished green and maroon foliage,
where cherry-blooms hung like fluffy balls of
pink smoke. The garden had a private entrance�a
gate in the outer lane�and over this was a small
tablet of unpainted wood:</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 317px; text-shadow: none;">
<img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Kingdom of Slender Swords, by Hallie Erminie Rives._files/i001.jpg" width="317" height="700" alt="">
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Which, translated, read:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">ALOYSIUS THORN</span></p>
<p class="cnotmargin" style="text-shadow: none;">Maker of Buddhas</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page55" id="page55" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
Directly opposite stood a small Christian Chapel.
It was newly built and still lacked its final decoration�a
rose-window, whose empty sashes were stopped
now with black cloth. High above the flowering
green its slanting roof lifted a cross.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It rose, white and pure, emblem of the Western
faith that yet had been born in the East. Over
against the ornate pageantry of Buddhist architecture,
in a land of another creed, of variant ideals
and a passionate devotion to them, it stood, simple,
silent, and watchful. The priest on the temple steps
was looking at the white cross, regarding it meditatively,
as one to whom concrete symbols are
badges of spiritual things.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Footsteps grated on the gravel and the occupant
of the older temple came slowly through its garden.
He was a foreigner, though dressed in Japanese
costume. His shoulders were broad and powerful
and he moved with a quickness and grace in step
and action that had something feline in it. His hair,
worn long, was black, touched with gray, and a
curved mustache hid his lips. His expression was
sensitively delicate and alertly odd�an impression
added to by deeply-set eyes, one of which was visibly
larger than the other, of the variety known as
"pearl," slightly bulbous, though liquid-brown and
heavily lashed.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The new-comer ascended the steps and stood a
moment silently beside the priest, watching the gluttonous
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page56" id="page56" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
pigeons. As he looked up, he saw the other's
gaze fixed on the Chapel cross. A quick shiver
ran across his mobile face, and passing, left it hard
with a kind of grim defiance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Presently the priest said in Japanese:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Christian temple across the way honorably
approaches completion. Assuredly, however, moths
have eaten my intelligence. Why does the gloomy
hole illustriously elect to remain in its wall?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is for a thing they call a 'window'," said
Thorn. "After a time they will put therein an august
abomination, representing sublimely hideous
cloud-born beings and idiotic-looking saints in colored
glass."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The priest nodded his shaven head sagely.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It will, perhaps, deign to be a <i style="text-shadow: none;">gaku</i> of the Christian
God. I shall, with deference, study it. I have
watered my worthless mind with much arrogant
reading of Him. Doubtless He was also Buddha
and taught The Way."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">An acolyte had come from the temple and approached
the red bell-tower. Midway of the huge
bronze bell a heavy cedar beam, like a catapult, was
suspended from two chains. He swung this till its
muffled end struck the metal rim, and the air
swelled with a dreamy sob of sound. He swung it
again, and the sob became a palpitant moan, like
breakers on a far-away beach. Again, and a deep
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page57" id="page57" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
velvety boom throbbed through the stillness like the
heart of eternity.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is time for the service," said the priest, and
turning, went into the temple, from whose interior
soon came the woodeny tapping of a <i style="text-shadow: none;">mok'gyo</i>�the
hollow wooden fish, which is the emblem of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Mon-to</i> sect�and the sound of chanting voices.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn, the man with whom the priest had spoken,
crossed the bridge to the other temple with a slow
step. He passed between the scowling guardian
figures, slid back a paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> and entered. The
room in which he stood had been the <i style="text-shadow: none;">haiden</i>, or
room of worship. Around its walls were oblong
carvings, marvelously lacquered, of the nine flowers
and nine birds of old Japanese art. In one were
set six large painted panels; the red seal they bore
was that of the great Cho Densu, the Fra Angelico
of Japan. In its center, under a brocade canopy,
was a raised platform once the seat of the High
Priest. It faced a long transept, like a chancel; this
ended in a short flight of steps leading, through
doors of soft, fretted gold-lacquer, to a huge altar
set with carved tables, great tarnished brasses and
garish furniture. The walls of the transept were
done in red with green ornamentations. From the
overhead gloom grotesque ph�nix and dragon
peered down and in the gathering dimness, shot
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page58" id="page58" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
through with the wan yellow gleam of brass, the
place seemed uncanny.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn drew back a heavy drapery which covered
a doorway, and entered a room that was windowless
and very dark. He lit a candle.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The dim light it furnished disclosed a weird and
silent assembly. The space was crowded with
strange glimmering deities�of bronze, of silver, of
priceless gold-lacquer�the dust thick on their
faces, their aureoles misty with cobwebs. Some
gazed with passionless serenity, or blessed with outstretched
hand; some threatened with scowling
faces and clenched thunderbolts: Jizo of the tender
smile, in whose sleeves nestle the souls of dead
children; Kwan-on, of divine compassion, with her
many hands; Emma-dai-O, Judge of the Dead,
menacing and terrible; strange sardonic <i style="text-shadow: none;">tengu</i>,
half-bird, half-human. The floor was thick with
them. From shelves on the walls leered swollen,
frog-like horrors such as often appear on Alaskan
totem-poles, triple-headed divinities of India and
China, coiled cobras, idols from Ceylon, and curious
Thibetan praying-wheels. A sloping stairway
slanted through the gloom; beside it was an image
of the red god, Aizen Bosatsu, his appalling countenance
framed in lurid flames, seated on a fiery
lotos.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The master of this celestial and infernal pantheon
closed and locked the door, and mounted the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page59" id="page59" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
stairway to the loft�a low, rambling room of eccentric
shape, under the curving gables.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Here, through a long window beneath the very
eaves, the light still came brightly. In the center
was a board table, littered with delicate carving-tools.
He kindled the charcoal in a bronze <i style="text-shadow: none;">hibachi</i>,
and set over it a copper pot which began to emit a
thick, weedy odor. From a cabinet he took phials
containing various powders, and measured into the
pot a portion from each. Lastly he added a quantity
of gold-leaf, slowly, flake by flake. At one side a
white silk cloth was draped over a pedestal; he drew
this away and looked at the unfinished figure it had
concealed. It was an image of Kwan-on, the All-Merciful.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Through the open window the chant of the
priests came clearly:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Waku hyoryu kokai</i></span><br style="text-shadow: none;">

<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">Nembi Kwan-on riki</i></span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">Har&#333; fun&#333;motsu.</i>"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">(He who is beset with perils of dragon
and great fish�who drifts on an endless
sea�if he offer petition to Kwan-on,
waves will not destroy him.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn crossed the room and leaning his elbows
on the window-ledge, looked out. Through the
odor of incense the monotonous intonation of the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page60" id="page60" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
liturgy rose with the grandeur of a Gregorian
chant:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Sh&#363;j&#333; kikon-yaku</i></span><br style="text-shadow: none;">

<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">N&#333;ku sekenku.</i>"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">(He who is in distress�when immeasurable
suffering presses on him�Kwan-on,
all-wise and all-powerful, can save
him from the world's calamity.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Once, while the quiet yard echoed back the slow
cadences of the antique tongue, the watcher's eyes
turned to the image on the pedestal, then came back
to an object that drew them�had drawn them for
many days against his will!�the white cross of the
Chapel. A last glow of refracted light touched it
now, as red as blood, a symbol of the infinite passion
and pain. A long time he stood there. The twilight
deepened, the chant ceased, lights sprang up along
the lane, night fell with its sickle moon and crowding
stars, but still he stood, his face between his hands.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At length he turned, and groping for the cloth,
threw it over the Kwan-on and lit a lamp swinging
from a huge brass censer. Unlocking an alcove, he
took out a fleece-wrapped bundle and sweeping the
tools to one side, set it on the table. He carefully
closed the window and thrust a bar through the
staple of the door before he unwrapped it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When the fleece was removed, he propped the

image it had contained upright on the table. He
poured into a shallow plate a few drops of the liquid
heating over the fire-bowl�under the lamplight it
gleamed and sparkled like molten gold�and with
a small brush, using infinite care, began to lay the
lacquer on its carven surface.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Once, at a sound in some room below�perhaps
the movement of a servant�he stopped and listened
intently. It was as if he worked by stealth, at some
labor self-forbidden, to which an impulse, overmastering
though half-denied, drove him in secret.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was a crucifix with a dead Christ upon it.</p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chVI" id="chVI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER VI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE BAYING OF THE WOLF-HOUND</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</span> stood in her room at the Embassy.
It was spacious and airy, the high walls
paneled in ivory-white, with draperies of
Delft blue. The bed and dressing-table were
early Adams. A generous bay-window set with
flower-boxes filled a large part of one side, and its
deep seat was upholstered in blue crepe, the tint of
the draperies, printed with large white chrysanthemums.
The floor was laid with thin matting of
rice-straw in which was braided at intervals a conventional
pattern in old-rose. Opposite the bay-window
stood a Sendai chest on which was a small
Japanese Buddha of gold-lacquer, Amida, the
Dweller-in-Light, seated in holy meditation on his
lotos-blossom. At first sight this had recalled to
Barbara a counterpart image which she had unearthed
in a dark corner of the garret in her pinafore
days, and which for a week had been her dearest
possession.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">To this room Mrs. Dandridge herself had taken
her, presenting to her Haru, whom the bishop's
note had brought�a vivid, eager figure from a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page63" id="page63" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
Japanese fan, who had sunk suddenly prone, every
line of her slender form bowed, hands palm-down
on the floor and forehead on them, in a ceremonious
welcome to the foreign <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i>. Her mauve
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> was woven with camelias in silver, set off by
an <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i>, showing a flight of storks on a blue background
and clasped in front with a silver firefly.
The heavy jet hair was rolled into wings on either
side, and a high puff surmounted her forehead. Thin
twin spirals, stiff with pomade, joined at the back
like the pinions of a butterfly, and against the blue-black
loops lay a bright knot of ribbon. She was
now moving about the room with silent padding of
light feet in snowy, digitated <i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi</i>, admiring the
gowns which the maid had taken from Barbara's
trunks. Occasionally she passed a slim hand up and
down a soft wrap with a graceful, purring regard,
or held a fleecy boa under her small oval chin and
stole a glance in the cheval glass with a little ecstatic
quiver of shoulder. Once she paused to look at the
lacquer image on the Sendai chest. "Buddha," she
said. "Japan man think very good for die-time."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Haru," said Barbara as the maid's busy Japanese
fingers went searching for elusive hooks and eyes,
"is it true that every Japanese name has a meaning?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So, <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i>! That mos' indeed true. All Japan
name mean something. 'Haru' mean spring, for because
my born that time. Very funny�<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page64" id="page64" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
"It is very pretty," said Barbara.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How tha's nize!" was the delighted exclamation.
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Mama-San</i> give name. My like name yella-ways
for because <i style="text-shadow: none;">mama-San</i> no more in this world.
My house little lonesome now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Where is your house, Haru? Near by?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The slender hand, pointed to the wooded height
behind the garden. "Jus' there on the street call
Prayer-to-the-gods. My house so-o-o small, an' garden
'bout such big." She indicated a space of perhaps
six feet square. "Funny!�<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And who lives there with you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Haru smiled brilliantly. "Oh, so-o-o many peoples!
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Papa-San</i>, an'�jus' me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No brother?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She shook her head. "My don' got," she said.
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Papa-San</i> very angry for because my jus' girl an'
no could be kill in Port Arthur!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She spoke with a smile, but the matter-of-fact
words brought suddenly home to Barbara something
of the flavor of that passionate loyalty, that
hot heroism and debonair contempt of death which
has been the theme of a hundred stories. "Do all
Japanese feel so, Haru?" she asked. "Would every
father be glad to give his son's life for Japan?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The girl looked at her as if she jested. "Of
<i style="text-shadow: none;">course</i>! All Japan man mos' happy if to be kill for
our Emperor! Tha's for why better to be man.
Girl jus' can stay home an' <i style="text-shadow: none;">wish</i>!" As the gown's
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page65" id="page65" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
last fastening was slipped into its place, she turned
up her lovely oval face with a smiling, sidelong
look.</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 454px; text-shadow: none;">
<img class="border" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Kingdom of Slender Swords, by Hallie Erminie Rives._files/i002.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="">
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ma-a-a!</i>" she exclaimed. "How it is <i style="text-shadow: none;">beau</i>-tee-ful!
<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�</i>? only�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Only what?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My thinks the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i> must suffer through the
center!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Laughingly Barbara caught the other's slim wrist
and drew her before the mirror. By oriental standards
the Japanese girl was as finely bred as herself.
In the two faces, both keenly delicate and sensitive,
yet so sharply contrasted�one palely olive under its
jetty pillow of straight black hair, the other fair and
brown-eyed, crowned with curling gold�the extremes
of East and West looked out at each other.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"See, Haru," said Barbara. "How different we
are!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You so more good-look!" sighed the Japanese
girl. "My jus' like the night."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah, but a moonlighted night," cried Barbara,
"soft and warm and full of secrets. When you have
a sweetheart you will be far more lovely to him
than any foreign girl could be!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Haru blushed rosily. "Sweetheart p'r'aps now,"
she said, "�all same kind America story say
'bout."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Have you really, Haru?" cried Barbara. "I
love to hear about sweethearts. Maybe�some day�I
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page66" id="page66" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
may have one, too. Some time you'll tell me
about him. Won't you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly, far below the window, there came a
snarling scramble and a savage, menacing bay. Barbara
leaned out. A tawny, long-muzzled wolf-hound,
fastened to a stake, glared up at her out of
red-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Poor fellow!" she exclaimed. "He looks sick.
Does he have to be tied up?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Japanese girl shivered. "Very bad dog,"
she said. "My think very danger to not kill."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The deep tone of the dinner gong shuddered
through the house and Barbara hastened out. Patricia
met her in the hall and the two girls, with
arms about each other's waists, descended the
broad angled stair to the dining-room, where the
Ambassador stood, tall and spare and iron-gray,
with a contagious twinkle in his kindly eye.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well," he asked, "did you feel the earthquake?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara gave an exclamation of dismay. "Has
there been one already?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pshaw!" he said contritely. "Perhaps there
hasn't. You see, in Japan, we get so used to asking
that question�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Now, Ned!" warned Mrs. Dandridge. "You'll
have Barbara frightened to death. We really don't
have them so very often, my dear�and only gentle
shakes. You mustn't be dreaming of Messina."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador pointed to the ceiling, where a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page67" id="page67" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>
wide crack zigzagged across. "There's a recent autograph
to bear me out. It happened on the eleventh
of last month."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Father remembers the date because of the horrible
accident it caused," said Patricia. "A piece of
the kitchen plaster came down in his favorite dessert
and we had to fall back on pickled plums.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm simply wild to see your gowns, Barbara,"
she continued, as they took their places. "Is that the
latest sleeve, and is everything going to be slinky?
We're always about six months behind. I know a
girl in Yokohama who goes to every steamer and
kodaks the smartest tourists. I've almost been
driven to do it myself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You should adopt the Japanese dress, Patsy,"
said Mrs. Dandridge. "How does it seem, Barbara,
to see <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> all around you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I can't get it out of my mind," she answered,
"that they are all wearing them for some sort of
masquerade."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It takes a few days to get used to it," said the
Ambassador. "And what a beautiful and practical
costume it is!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And comfortable!" sighed Patricia. "No 'bones'
or tight places, and only four or five things to put
on. I don't wonder European women look queer
to the Japanese. The cook's wife told me the other
day that the first foreign lady she ever saw looked
to her like a wasp with a wig on like a <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> devil."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page68" id="page68" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
There rose again on the still night air the savage
bay Barbara had heard in her room. "I'm afraid I
must make up my mind to lose Shiro," the Ambassador
said regretfully. "He's a Siberian wolf-hound
that a friend sent me from Moscow. But the climate
doesn't agree with him, apparently. For the last two
days he's seemed really unsafe. There's a famous
Japanese dog-doctor in this section, but he's been
sick himself and I haven't liked to go to an ordinary
native 'vet.' But I shall have him looked at to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I do hope you will," said Mrs. Dandridge nervously.
"He almost killed Patsy's Pomeranian the
first day he came. Watanab� says he hasn't touched
his food to-day, and we can't take any risks with so
many children in the compound. We have forty-seven,
Barbara," she continued, "counting the stablemen's
families, and some of them are the dearest
mites! Every Christmas we give them a tree. It
makes one feel tremendously patriarchal!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was a home-like meal, albeit thin slices of
lotos-stem floated in Barbara's soup, the lobster had
no claws, and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">entr�e</i> was baked bamboo. Save
for a high, four-paneled screen of gold-leaf with
delicate etchings of snow-clad pines, the white room
was without ornament, but the table gleamed with
old silver, and in its center was a great bowl of pink
azaleas. Smooth-faced Japanese men-servants came
and went noiselessly in snowy footwear and dark
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page69" id="page69" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
silk <i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i> whose sleeves bore the Embassy eagle in
silver thread.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador was a man of keen observation,
and a cheerful philosophy. His theory of life was
expressed in a saying of his: "Human-kind is about
the same as it has always been, except a good deal
kinder." He had learned the country at first hand.
He had a profound appreciation of its whole historical
background, one gained not merely from libraries,
but from deeper study of the essential qualities
of Japanese character and feeling. He had the perfect
gift, moreover, of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">raconteur</i>, and he held
Barbara passionately attentive as he sketched, in
bold outlines, the huge picture of Japanese modernization.
Yet light as was his touch, he nevertheless
made her see beneath the veneer of the foreign,
the unaltering ego of a civilization old and austere,
of unfamiliar, strenuous ideals, with cast steel conventions,
eternal mysteries of character and of racial
destiny.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Coffee was served in the small drawing-room�a
home-like, soft-toned room of crystal-paned bookcases,
and furniture that had been handed down in
the Dandridge family from candle-lighted colony
days.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It seems a shame," said Mrs. Dandridge, "that
this evening has to be broken, but Patsy and I
must look in at the Charity Bazaar. I'm sure you
won't mind, Barbara, if we leave you alone now for
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page70" id="page70" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
an hour or so. It's a new idea: every lady is to
bring something she has no further use for, but
which is too good to throw away."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I presume," observed the Ambassador innocently,
"that some of them will bring their husbands."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ned," said Mrs. Dandridge, as she drew on her
wrap, "people will soon think you haven't a serious
side. It would serve you right if I took you along
as my contribution."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah," returned he, "I was thoughtful enough to
make a previous engagement. Doctor Bersonin is
coming to see me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Patsy's nose took a decided elevation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Government expert," she said. "He was
on the train. It's the first time I ever saw him without
that smart-looking Japanese head-boy of his
who goes with him everywhere as interpreter."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I've noticed that," Mrs. Dandridge said. "He's
always with him in his automobile. By the way,
Patsy, who <i style="text-shadow: none;">does</i> that boy remind me of? It has
always puzzled me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why," Patricia answered, "he looks something
like that Japanese student we saw so often the winter
Barbara and we were in Monterey. You remember,
Barbara�the one who spoke such perfect
English. We thought he was loony, because he used
to sit on the beach all day and sail little wooden
boats."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page71" id="page71" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
"So he does," said her mother. "There's a decided
resemblance. But Doctor Bersonin's boy is
anything but loony. He has a most intelligent face."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Besides," said Patricia, "the other was nearsighted
and wore spectacles. Good-by, Barbara. I
hope the doctor will be gone when we get back."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her voice came muffled from the hall "�Oh, I
can't help it, mother! I'm only a diplomat-once-removed!
He <i style="text-shadow: none;">is</i> horrid!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page72" id="page72" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chVII" id="chVII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER VII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">DOCTOR BERSONIN</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> Ambassador received his caller in his
study. From across the hall, Barbara,
through the half-open door, could see the expert's
huge form filling an arm-chair, where the
limpid light of the desk-lamp fell on his heavy, colorless
face. The walls were lined with bookshelves
and curtains of low tone, and against this formless
background his big profile stood out pallid and
hawk-like. She could hear his voice distinctly. Its
even, dead flatness affected her curiously; it was not
harsh, but absolutely without tone-quality or sympathy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For some time the talk was on casual topics and
she occupied herself listlessly with a tray of photographs
on the table. She read their titles, smiling
at the extraordinary intricacies of "English as she is
Japped" by the complaisant oriental photographer:
<i style="text-shadow: none;">The Picking Sea-Ear at Enoshima</i>; <i style="text-shadow: none;">East-looking
Panorama of Fuji Mount</i>; <i style="text-shadow: none;">Geisha in the Famous
Dance of Maple-Leaf</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The smile left her face. Something had been
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page73" id="page73" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
said in the farther room which caught her attention
and in a moment she found herself listening intently.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I understand the trials of the new powder have
been very successful," the Ambassador was saying.
"Is it destined to revolutionize warfare, do you
think?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is too soon to tell yet," was the reply, "just
what the result will be. It will enormously increase
the range of projectiles, as Your Excellency may
guess, and its area of destruction will nearly double
that of lyddite."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara felt, rather than saw, that the Ambassador
gave a little shudder. "I can imagine what
that means," he said. "I saw Port Arthur after
the siege. So war is to grow more dreadful still!
When will it cease, I wonder."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Never," Bersonin answered, with a cold smile.
"It is the love of power that makes war, and that,
in man, is inherent and ineradicable. A nation is
only the individual in the aggregate, and selfishness
is the guiding gospel of both."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">To Barbara the words seemed coldly, cruelly repellant.
She felt a sudden quiver of dislike run
over her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You paint a sorry picture," said the Ambassador.
"Can human ingenuity go much further,
then? What, in your opinion, will be the fighting
engine of the future?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The engine of the future"�Bersonin spoke deliberately�"will
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page74" id="page74" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
be along other lines. It will be an
atomic one. It will employ no projectile and no
armor plate will resist it. The discoverer will have
harnessed the law of molecular vibration. As there
is a positive force that binds atoms together, so
there must be a negative force that, under certain
conditions, can drive them apart!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He spoke with what seemed an extraordinary
conviction. His manner had subtly changed. For
the first time his tone had gathered something like
feeling, and the dry, metallic voice seemed to Barbara
to vibrate with a curious, gloating triumph.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Granted such a force," he went on, "and a machine
to generate and direct it, and of what value
is the most powerful battle-ship, the most stupendous
fort? Mere silly shreds of steel and stone!
Why, such an engine might be carried in a single
hand, and yet the nation that possessed it could be
master of the world!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A dark flush had risen to his pallid cheek, and on
the arm of his chair Barbara saw the massive fingers
of one huge hand clench and unclench with a
furtive, nervous gesture. The sight gave her a
sharp sense of recoil as if from the touch of something
sinister and evilly suggestive.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No!" said the Ambassador vehemently. "Humanity
would revolt. Such a discovery would be
worth less than nothing! Its use by any warring
nation would call down the execration of civilization,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page75" id="page75" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
and the man who knew the secret would be
too dangerous to be at large!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was dead silence for a moment. Bersonin
sat motionless, staring straight before him. Very
slowly the color seemed to fade from his cheek.
When he spoke again his voice had regained its
dead level of tonelessness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That has occurred to me," he said. "I think
Your Excellency is right. Invention may do its
work too well. However�no doubt we speak of
scientific impossibilities; let us hope so, at any rate."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara pushed the photographs aside and
slipped into the next room, closing the door and
drawing the heavy porti�res that hung over it. She
had had for a moment a vague, almost childish,
sense of shrinking as if from something monstrous
and uncanny�such a sensation as the naked diver
may have, when, peering through his water-glass,
he sees a dim grisly shape glide, stealthy and cold,
through the opaque depths. She was growing absurdly
fanciful, she thought. She did not turn on
the electric light, but threw open one of the long,
French windows. There was a new moon and a
pale radiance flooded the room, with a sudden odor
of wistaria and plum-blossoms. The window gave
on to a porch running the length of the house, and
this made her think suddenly of home. Yet the air
was too humid for California, too moist and rich
even for Florida. And suddenly she found herself
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page76" id="page76" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
pitying the people there to whom the East would
always be a closed book. Yet how dim and vague
Japan had been to her a month before!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A grand piano stood open by the window and in
the dim light she sat down and let her fingers wander
idly in long arpeggios. She could see one side
of the Japanese garden, with a glimpse of a tiny
dry lake and a pebbled rivulet spanned by an arching
bridge of red lacquer. It ended in a sharp,
sloping hill covered with shrubbery. On the ridge
far above she distinguished the outlines of native
houses and flanking them the curved, Tartar-like
gables of a gray old temple. Somewhere, beyond
that little hill, perhaps, stood the Chapel erected to
her father's memory, which she had yet to see. As
her fingers strayed over the ivory keys, she thought
of him, of his vivid, aberrant career and untimely
end.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There are nights in the Japanese spring when the
landscape, in its wondrous delicacy of tones, seems
only an envelope of something subtler and unseen,
the filmy covering of a beauty that is wholly spiritual.
To-night it seemed so to Barbara. The close
was very still, wrapped in a dreamy haze as soft as
sleep, the mountains on the horizon wan shapes of
silver mist, semi-diaphanous. It seemed to her that
in this living, sentient breath of Japan, her father
was nearer to her than he had ever been before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The thought brought to her vague memories of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page77" id="page77" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
her mother and of her childhood. Old airs began
to mingle with the chords, and on the shrill fairy
sound-carpet woven by the myriad insect-looms of
the garden, the bits of melody went treading softly
out across the perfume of the wistaria.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page78" id="page78" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span></p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">"SALLY IN OUR ALLEY"</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">She</span> thought no one heard, but out by the
azalea hedge, a man was standing, listening
to the hushed chords floating through the open
window.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From the bungalow on the Yokohama Bluff,
Daunt had come back to Tokyo with a sense of
dissatisfaction deeper than should have been caused
by his jarring talk with Phil. Perhaps, though he
did not guess it, his mood had to do with a bulky
letter in his pocket, received that day. It was from
"Big" Murray, his chum at college, whom he had
commonly addressed by opprobrious epithets that
covered an affection time had not diminished. Of
all the men in his class Daunt would have picked
him as the one least likely to marry. Yet the letter
had contained a wedding-invitation and a ream
of the usual hyperbole. "Going to name me godfather,
is he!" Daunt had muttered as he read.
"The driveling old horse-thief!" For in some
elusive way the intended distinction suggested that
he himself was a hoary back-number, not to be reckoned
among the forces of youth. Strolling from
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page79" id="page79" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
Shimbashi Station, under the clustered, gaily-colored
paper-lanterns, swaying above the rustle and stir of
the exotic street, this thought rankled. A vague discontent
stirred in him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Tokyo had been the objective point of Daunt's six
years of diplomatic career, and he had found the
Kingdom of the Slender Swords a fascinating and
absorbing study. He loved its contrasts and its
contradictions, its marvelous artistry, the reserve
and nobility of its people, and its savage, unshamed,
sincerity of purpose. In the absorbing routine of the
Chancery and the bright gaieties of the capital's
diplomatic circle, the first year had gone swiftly
enough. Since then the Glider experiments had
lent an added zest.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Even at college, Langley's first a�roplane had interested
him and out of that interest had grown a
course of reading which had given him a broad
technical knowledge of applied mechanics. In Japan
he had conceived the idea of the new fan-propeller,
worked out in many an hour of study in the little
Japanese house in Aoyama, which he had taken because
it adjoined the parade-ground where his earliest
experiments were made. At first the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Corps Diplomatique</i>
had smiled at this as a harmless <i style="text-shadow: none;">pour
passer le temps</i>, to be classified with the Roumanian
Minister's kennel of Pomeranians or the Chilian
Secretary's collection of <i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyo</i> dolls. But week
by week the little crowd of Japanese spectators had
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page80" id="page80" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;80]</span>
grown larger; often Daunt had recognized among
the attentive brown faces this or that superior military
officer whom he knew, albeit in civilian dress.
One day his friend, Viscount Sakai, a dapper young
officer on the General Staff, had surprised him
with the offer from the Japanese War Department
of the use of an empty garage on the edge
of the great esplanade. Only a month ago, he
had awaked to the knowledge that his name was
known to the a�ro enthusiasts of Paris, New York
and Vienna, and that his propeller was an assured
success.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Yet to-night he felt that he had somehow failed.
The splendid vitality of the moving scene, the thud
and click of wooden <i style="text-shadow: none;">g�ta</i> and the whirr of <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>�all
the many-keyed diapason of the rustling, lanterned
vistas stretching under the pale moon-lighted
sky�lacked the sense of intimate companionship.
The warm still air, freighted with aromatic scents
of cedar from some new-built shop, the pungent
smell of incense burning before some shadowed
shrine, the odors of drenched shrubbery behind the
massive retaining wall of some rich noble's compound,
came to him with a new sense of estrangement.
The murmured sound of voices behind the
glimmering paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> told him, suddenly, that he
was lonely. For the first time in six years, he was
feeling keenly his long isolation from the things of
home, the pleasant fellowship and the firesides of old
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page81" id="page81" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
friends. In this foreign service which he so loved,
he had been growing out of touch, he told himself,
out of thought, of the things "Big" Murray had
sought and found.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Unconsciously, the "drivel," as he had denominated
it, of the letter in his pocket, had infected
him with sweet and foolish imaginings, and
slowly these took the nebulous shape of a woman.
He had often dreamed of her, though he had never
seen her face. It was half-veiled now in the bluish
haze of his pipe, while she talked to him before a
fire of driftwood (that burned with red and blue
lights because of sea-ghosts in it) and her voice was
low and clear like a flute.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The wavering outline was still before his mind's
eye as he trod the quiet road that led to the Embassy,
entered its wide gate and slowly crossed the silent
garden toward his bachelor cottage on the lawn.
And there, suddenly, the vision had seized a vagrant
melody and had spoken to him in song. Daunt
thrust his cold pipe into his pocket and listened with
head thrown back.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was no brilliant display of technique that held
him, for the player was touching simple chords, but
these were singing old melodies that took him far to
other scenes and other times. He smiled to himself.
How long it had been since he had sung them�not
since the old college days! That happy, irresponsible
era of senior dignities came back vividly to
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page82" id="page82" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
him, the campus and the singing. For years he had
not recollected it all so keenly! He had been glee-club
soloist, pushed forward on all occasions and
applauded to the echo. Praise of his singing he had
accepted somewhat humorously�never but once had
it touched him deeply, and that had been on commencement
afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He had slipped away from the wavering cheers
at the station, because he could not bear the farewells,
and, far down one of the campus lanes, had
come on pretty Mrs. Claybourne sitting on a rustic
bench. Again he heard her speak, as plainly as if it
were yesterday: "Why, if it isn't Mr. Daunt! I
wonder how the university can open in the fall without
you!" He had sat down beside her as she said:
"This very insistent young person with me has been
heartbroken because we could not get tickets for the
Glee-Club Concert last night. She wanted to hear
you sing."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He had looked up then to see a young girl, seated
on the leaning trunk of a tulip-tree. Her neutral-tinted
skirt lay against the dark bark; her face was
almost hidden by a spray of the great, creamy-pink
blossoms. Some quality in its delicate loveliness had
made him wish to please her, and sitting there he
had sung the song that was his favorite. Mrs. Claybourne
had pulled a big branch of the tulip-tree to
hand him like a bouquet over the footlights, but the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page83" id="page83" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
girl's parted lips, her wide deep brown eyes, had
thanked him in a better way!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The music, now floating over the garden, by such
subconscious association, recalled this scene, overlaid,
but never forgotten. Hark! A cascade of silver
notes, and then an old air that had been revived in
his time to become the madness of the music-halls
and the pet of the pianolas�the one the crowded
campus had been wont to demand with loudest voice
when his tenor led the "Senior Singing." It brought
back with a rush the familiar faces, the gray ivied
dormitories with their slim iron balconies, the throbbing
plaint of mandolins, and his own voice�</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"Of all the girls that are so smart,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">There's none like pretty Sally!</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">She is the darling of my heart,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">And she lives��"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He scarcely knew he sang, but the vibrant tenor,
lifting across the scent of the wistaria, came clearly
to the girl at the piano. For a moment Barbara's
fingers played on, as she listened with a strained
wonder. Then the music ceased with a discord and
she came quickly through the opened window.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The song was smitten from Daunt's lips. In the
instant that she stood outlined on the broad piazza,
a fierce snarling yelp and a clatter came from within
the house and there rang out a screamed Japanese
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page84" id="page84" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
warning. An outer door flew open and the huge
figure of Doctor Bersonin ran out, pursued by a leaping
white shadow, while the air thrilled to the savage
cry of a hound, shaken with rage.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Run, Barbara!</i>" The Ambassador's voice came
from the doorway. But the white, moonlit figure,
in its gauzy evening gown, turned too late. Empty-handed,
Daunt dashed for the piazza, as, with a
crash, a heavy porch chair, hurled by a Japanese
house-boy, penned the animal for an instant in a corner.
He caught the white figure up in his arms,
sprang into the shade of the wistaria arbor, and set
her feet on its high railing. The voice from the
doorway called again, sharply.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"This way, Doctor! <i style="text-shadow: none;">Quick!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The wolf-hound, trailing its broken chain, had
leaped the barrier and was launched straight at the
crouching expert. The latter had dragged something
small and square from his pocket and he
seemed now to hold this out before him. Daunt,
wrenching a cleat from the arbor railing, felt
a puff of cold wind strike his face, and something
like an elfin note of music, high and thin as an insect's,
drifted across the confusion. He rushed forward
with his improvised weapon�then stopped
short. The dog was no longer there.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador made an exclamation. He
stepped down and peered under the piazza; even in
the dim light the long space was palpably empty.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page85" id="page85" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
The head-boy spoke rapidly in Japanese and pointed
toward the gate.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He says he must have jumped down this side,"
explained Daunt, "and run out to the street. He's
nowhere in the garden, at any rate. We can see
every inch. How surprising!" He spoke to the boy
in the vernacular. "He will have the gates closed
at once and telephone a warning to the police
station."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin had sat down on the edge of the piazza.
He was crouched far over; his big frame was shaken
with violent shudderings. Suddenly his head went
back and he began to laugh�a jarring, grating,
weird man-hysteria that seemed to burst suddenly
beyond his control.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador went to him hurriedly, but Bersonin
shook off the hand on his shoulder and rising,
still emitting his dreadful laughter, staggered across
the lawn and out of the gate.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The appalling mirth re�choed from far down the
quiet road.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page86" id="page86" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chIX" id="chIX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER IX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE WEB OF THE SPIDER</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin</span> walked on, fighting desperately
with his ghastly spasm of merriment.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was a nervous affection which had
haunted him for years. It dated from a time when,
in South America, in an acute crisis of desperate personal
hazard, he had laughed the first peal of that
strange laughter of which he was to be ever after
afraid. Since then it had seized him many times,
unexpectedly and in moments of strong excitement,
to shake him like a lath. It had given him a morbid
hatred of laughter in others. Recently he had
thought that he was overcoming the weakness�for
in two years past he had had no such seizure�and
the recurrence to-night shocked and disconcerted
him. He, the man of brain and attainment, to be
held captive by a ridiculous hysteria, like a nerve-racked
an�mic girl! The cold sweat stood on his
forehead.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Before long the paroxysms ceased and he grew
calmer. The quiet road had merged into a busier
thoroughfare. He walked on slowly till his command
was regained. West of the outer moat of the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page87" id="page87" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
Imperial Grounds, he turned up a pleasant lane-like
street and presently entered his own gate. The
house, into which he let himself with a latch-key,
was a rambling, modern, two-story structure of yellow
stucco. The lower floor was practically unused,
since its tenant lived alone and did not entertain.
The upper floor, besides the hall, contained a small
bedroom, a bath and dressing-room and a large,
barely-furnished laboratory. The latter was lined
on two sides with glass-covered shelves which gave
glimpses of rows of books, of steel shells, metal and
crystal retorts and crucibles, the delicate paraphernalia
of organic chemistry and complicated instruments
whose use no one knew save himself�a fit
setting for the great student, the peer of Offenbach
in Munich and of Bayer in Vienna. Against the wall
leaned a drafting-board, on which, pinned down by
thumb-tacks, was a sketch-plan of a revolving turret.
From a bracket in a corner�the single airy touch of
delicacy in a chamber almost sordid in its appointments�swung
a bamboo cage with a brown <i style="text-shadow: none;">hiwa</i>,
or Japanese finch, a downy puff of feathers with its
head under its wing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the upper hall Bersonin's Japanese head-boy
had been sitting at a small desk writing. Bersonin
entered the laboratory, opened a safe let into a wall,
and put into it something which he took from his
pocket. Then he donned a dressing-gown the boy
brought, and threw himself into a huge leather chair.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page88" id="page88" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
"Make me some coffee, Ishida," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The servant did so silently and deftly, using a
small brass <i style="text-shadow: none;">samovar</i> which occupied a table of its
own. With the coffee he brought his master a box
of brown Havana cigars.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For an hour Bersonin sat smoking in the silent
room�one cigar after another, deep in thought, his
yellow eyes staring at nothing. Into his countenance
deep lines had etched themselves, giving to
his coldly repellant look an expression of malignant
force and intention. With his pallid face, his stirless
attitude, his great white fingers clutching the
arms of the chair, he suggested some enormous,
sprawling batrachian awaiting its more active prey.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">All at once there came a chirp from the cage in
the corner and its tiny occupant, waked by the electric-light,
burst into song as clear and joyous as
though before its free wing lay all the meads of
Eden. A look more human, soft and almost companionable,
came into its master's massive face. Bersonin
rose and, whistling, opened the cage door and
held out an enormous forefinger. The little creature
stepped on it, and, held to his cheek, it rubbed its
feathered head against it. For a moment he crooned
and whistled to it, then held his finger to the cage and
it obediently resumed its perch and its melody. The
expert took a dark cloth from a hook and threw it
over the cage and the song ceased.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin went to the door of the room and fastened
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page89" id="page89" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
it, then unlocked a desk and spread some papers
on the table. One was a chart, drawn to the minutest
scale, of the harbor of Yokohama. On it had
been marked a group of projectile-shaped spots suggesting
a flotilla of vessels at anchor. For a long
time he worked absorbedly, setting down figures,
measuring with infinite pains, computing angles�always
with reference to a small square in the map's
inner margin, marked in red. He covered many
sheets of paper with his calculations. Finally he took
another paper from the safe and compared the two.
He lifted his head with a look of satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Just then he thought he heard a slight noise from
the hall. Swiftly and noiselessly as a great cat he
crossed to the door and opened it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ishida sat in his place scratching laboriously with
a foreign pen.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin's glance of suspicion altered. "What
are you working at so industriously, Ishida?" he
asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Japanese boy displayed the sheet with pride.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was an ode to the coming Squadron. Bersonin
read it:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i4" style="text-shadow: none;">"Welcome, foreign men-of-war!</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">

</div>

<p style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page90" id="page90" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">

<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">By H. Ishida, with best compliment.</i>"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin laid it down with a word of approbation.
"Well done," he said. "You will be a famous English
scholar before long." He went into the dressing-room,
but an instant later recollected the papers
on the table. The servant was in the laboratory
when his master hastily reentered; he was methodically
removing the coffee tray.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Alone once more, Ishida reseated himself at his
small desk. He tore the poem carefully to small bits
and put them into the waste-paper basket. Then,
rubbing the cake of India-ink on its stone tablet, he
drew a mass of Japanese writing toward him and,
with brush held vertically between thumb and forefinger,
began to trace long, delicate characters at the
top of the first sheet, thus:</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 600px; text-shadow: none;">
<img src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of The Kingdom of Slender Swords, by Hallie Erminie Rives._files/i003.jpg" width="600" height="109" alt="Ouryuu no fusetsusuirai ni oyobosu eikyou
hidarino toori kinji" title="Ouryuu no fusetsusuirai ni oyobosu eikyou
hidarino toori kinji">
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the Japanese phrase this might literally be
translated as follows:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin" style="text-shadow: none;">cross-current of, laying water thunder on,</p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">work-effect</p>
<p class="cnotmargin" style="text-shadow: none;">left hand respectively</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page91" id="page91" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
Which in conventional English is to say:</p>

<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">A STUDY OF CROSS-CURRENTS IN THEIR EFFECT ON</span></p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">SUBMARINE MINES</span></p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">SUBMITTED WITH DEFERENCE</span></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">This finished, he sealed it in an envelope, took a
book from the breast of his <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> and began to
read. Its cover bore the words: "Second English
Primer, in words of Two Syllables." Its inner pages,
however, belied the legend. It was Mahan's <i style="text-shadow: none;">Influence
of Sea-Power on History</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Yet Lieutenant Ishida of the Japanese Imperial
Navy, one time student in Monterey, California, now
in Special Secret-Service, read abstractedly. He
was wondering why Doctor Bersonin should have in
his possession a technical naval chart and what was
the meaning of certain curious markings he had
made on it.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page92" id="page92" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chX" id="chX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER X<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">IN A GARDEN OF DREAMS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">In</span> the garden the moon's faint light glimmered
on the broad, satiny leaves of the camelias and
the delicate traceries of red maple foliage. At
its farther side, amid flowering bushes which cast
long indigo shadows, stood a small pagoda, brought
many years before from Korea, and toward this
Daunt and the girl whom he had held for a breathless
moment in his arms, strolled slowly along
a winding, pebbled path tremulant with the flickering
shadows of little leaves. The structure had a small
platform, and here on a bench they sat down, the
fragrant garden spread out before them.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He had remembered that a guest had been expected
to arrive that day from America, and knew
that this must be she. But, strangely enough, it did
not seem as if they had never before met. Nor
had he the least idea that, since that short sharp
scene, they had exchanged scarcely a dozen words.
In its curious sequel, as he stood listening to the
echo of Bersonin's strange laughter, he had momentarily
forgotten all about her. Then he had remembered
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page93" id="page93" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
with a shock that he had left her perched, in
evening dress, on the high railing of the arbor.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wonder if you are in the habit," she had said
with a little laugh, "of putting unchaperoned girls
on the tops of fences, and going away and forgetting
all about them."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her laugh was deliciously uneven, but it did not
seem so from fright. He had answered something
inordinately foolish, and had lifted her down again�not
holding her so closely this time. He remembered
that on the first occasion he had held her very
tightly indeed. He could still feel the touch of a wisp
of her hair which, in his flying leap, had fallen
against his cheek. It was red-bronze and it shone
now in the moonlight like molten metal. Her eyes
were deep blue, and when she smiled�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He wrenched his gaze away with a start. But it
did not stray far�merely to the point of a white-beaded
slipper peeping from the edge of a ruffle of
gauze that had mysteriously imprisoned filmy sprays
of lily-of-the-valley.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked up suddenly, conscious that she was
laughing silently. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"We seem so tremendously acquainted," she said,
"for people who�" She stopped an instant. "You
don't even know who I am."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the references to her coming he had heard her
name spoken and now, by a sheer mental effort, he
managed to recall it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page94" id="page94" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
"You are Miss Fairfax," he said. "And my
name, perhaps I ought to add, is Daunt. I am the
Secretary of Embassy. I hope, after our little effort
of to-night, you will not consider diplomacy only
high-class vaudeville. Such comedy scarcely represents
our daily bill."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It came near enough to being tragedy," she
answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was so uncommonly life-like, I was torn with
a fear that you might not guess it was gotten up for
your especial benefit."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How well you treat your visitors!" she said with
gentle irony. "Had you many rehearsals?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Very few," he said. "I was afraid the boy might
misread the stage direction and slip the dog-chain
too soon. But I am greatly pleased. I have always
had an insatiable longing to be a hero�if only on
the stage. I aspire to Grand Opera, also, as you
have noticed." He laughed, a trifle shamefacedly,
then added quickly: "I hope you liked the final disappearance
act. It was rather effective, don't you
think?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She smiled unwillingly. "Ah, you make light of
it! But don't think I didn't know how quickly you
acted�what you risked in that one minute! And
then to run back a second time!" She shuddered a
little. "You could have done nothing with that
piece of wood!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I assure you," he said, "you underrate my
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page95" id="page95" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
prowess! But it wasn't to be used�it was only the
dog's cue."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Poor brute!" she said. "I hope he will injure
nobody."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Luckily, the children are off the streets at this
hour," he answered. "He'll not go far; the police
are too numerous. I am afraid our very efficient
performer is permanently retired from the company.
But I haven't yet congratulated you. You didn't
seem one bit afraid."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I hadn't time to be frightened. I�was thinking
of something else! The fright came afterward,
when I saw you�when you left me on the railing."
She spoke a little constrainedly, and went on quickly:
"I really am a desperate coward about some things.
I should never dare to go up on an a�roplane, for
instance, as Patsy tells me you do almost every day.
She says the Japanese call you the 'Honorable Fly-Man'."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There's no foreign theater in Tokyo, and no
winter Opera," he said lightly. "We have to amuse
one another, and the Glider is by way of contributing
my share of the entertainment. It is certainly an
uplifting performance." He smiled, but she shook
her head.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah," she said, "I know! I was at Fort Logan
last summer the day Lieutenant Whitney was killed.
I saw it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The smile had faded and her eyes had just the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page96" id="page96" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
look he had so often fancied lay in those eyes he had
been used to gaze at across the burning driftwood�his
"Lady of the Many-Colored Fires." He caught
himself longing to know that they would mist and
soften if he too should some day come to grief in
such sudden fashion. They were wholly wonderful
eyes! He had noted them even in the instant when
he had snatched her from the piazza�from the
danger into which his cavalier singing had called
her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How brazen you must have thought it!" he exclaimed.
"My impromptu solo, I mean. I hardly
know how I came to do it. I suppose it was the
moonlight (it does make people idiotic sometimes,
you know, in the tropics!) and then what you played�that
dear old song! I used to sing it years ago.
It reminded me�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes�?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Of the last evening at college. It was a night
like this, though not so lovely. I sang it then�my
last college solo."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Your <i style="text-shadow: none;">last</i>?" She was leaning toward him, her
lips parted, her eyes bright on his face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he said. "I left town the next day."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her eyes fell. She turned half away, and put a
hand to her cheek. "Oh," she said vaguely. "Of
course."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But it <i style="text-shadow: none;">was</i> brazen," he finished lamely. "I
promise never to do it again."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page97" id="page97" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
The breath of the night was coolly sweet. It
hovered about them, mingled of all the musky winds
and flower-months of Eden. A dulled, weird sound
from the street reached their ears�the monotonous
hand-tapping of a small, shallow drum.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Some Buddhist <i style="text-shadow: none;">devot�e</i>," he said, "making a
pious round of holy places. He is stalking along in
a dingy, white cotton robe with red characters
stamped all over it�one from each shrine he has
visited�and here and there in a doorway he will
stop to chant a prayer in return for a handful of
rice."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How strange! It doesn't seem to belong, somehow,
with the telegraph wires and the trolley cars.
Japan is full of such contrasts, isn't it? It seems to
be packed with mystery and secrets. Listen!" The
deep, resonant boom of a great bell at a distance had
throbbed across the nearer strumming. "That must
be in some old temple. Perhaps the man with the
drum is going there to worship. Does any one live
in the temples? The priests do, I suppose."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he answered. "Sometimes other people
do, too. I know of a foreigner who lives in one."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What is he? European?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No one knows. He has lived there fifteen years.
He calls himself Aloysius Thorn. I used to think
he must be an American, for in the Chancery safe
there is an envelope bearing his name and the direction
that it be opened after his death. It has been
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page98" id="page98" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;98]</span>
there a long time, for the paper is yellow with age.
No doubt it was put there by some former Chief-of-Mission
at his request. He has nothing to do with
other foreigners; as a rule he won't even speak to
them. He is something of a curiosity. He knows
some lost secret about gold-lacquer, they say."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Is he young?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Married?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, no! He lives quite alone. He has one of
the loveliest private gardens in the city. Sometimes
one doesn't see him for months, but he is here now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was silent, while he looked again at the white
toe of the slipper peeping from a gauzy hem. The
silence seemed to him an added bond between them.
The moon, tilting its slim sickle along the solemn
range of western hills, touched their jagged contour
with a shimmering radiance and edged with silver
the vast white apparition towering, filmily exquisite,
above them, a solitary snowy cone, hovering wraith-like
between earth and sky. The horizon opposite
was deep violet, crowded with tiny stars, like green-gilt
coals. In the quiet a drowsy crow croaked huskily
from the hillside. Barbara looked through dreamy
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It can't always be so beautiful!" she said at
length. "Nothing could, I am sure."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No, indeed," he agreed cheerfully. "There are
times when, as my number-one boy says, 'honorable
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page99" id="page99" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
weather are disgust.' In June the <i style="text-shadow: none;">nubai</i>, the rainy
season, is due. It will pour buckets for three weeks
without a stop and frogs will sing dulcet songs in the
streets. In July your head feels as if a red-hot
feather pillow had been stuffed into your skull and
everybody moves to Chuzenji or Kamakura. If it
weren't for that, and an occasional dust-storm in
the winter, and the centillions of mosquitoes, and a
weekly earthquake or two, we wouldn't half appreciate
this!" He made a wide gesture.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yet now," she said softly, "it seems too lovely to
be real! I shall wake presently to find myself in my
berth on the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Tenyo Maru</i> with Japan two or three
days off."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He fell into her mood. "We are both asleep.
That was why the dog vanished so queerly. Dream-dogs
always do. And I don't wonder at my singing,
either. People do exactly what they shouldn't when
they are asleep. But no! I really don't like the
dream version at all. I want this to be true."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her tone was low, but it made him tingle. A sudden
<i style="text-shadow: none;">m�l�e</i> of daring, delicious impulses swept over
him. "Because I have dreamed too much," he said,
in as low a voice. "Here in the East the habit grows
on one; we dream of what all the beauty somehow
misses�for us. But to-night, at least, is real. I
shall have it to remember when you have gone, as I�I
suppose you will be soon."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page100" id="page100" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
She leaned out and picked a slender maple-leaf
from a branch that came in through the open side of
the pagoda, and, holding it in her fingers, turned toward
him. Her lips were parted, as if to speak. But
suddenly she tossed it from her, rose and shook out
her skirts with a laugh. Carriage-wheels were rolling
up the drive from the lower gate.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Thank you!" she cried gaily. "But no hint shall
move me. I warn you that I intend to stay a long
time!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the lighted doorway, as Patricia and her mother
stepped from the carriage, she swept him a curtsey.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Honorably deign to accept my thanks," she said,
"for augustly saving my insignificant life! And
now, perhaps, we can be properly introduced!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page101" id="page101" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span></p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">ISHIKICHI</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Under</span> the frail moon that touched the Embassy
garden to such beauty, Haru walked
home to the house "so-o-o small, an' garden
'bout such big" in the Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On Reinanzaka Hill the shadows were iris-hearted.
From its high-walled gardens of the great came
no glimpses of phantom-lighted <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>, no sound of
vibrant strings from tea-houses nor gleams of painted
lips and fingers of <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Haru carried a paper-lantern tied to the end of
a short wand, but it was not dark enough to need
its light, and as she walked, she swung it in graceful
circles. She heard a dove sobbing its low <i style="text-shadow: none;">owas!
owas!</i> and once a crow flapped its sleepy way above
her, uttering its harsh note, which, from some
subtlety of suggestion hidden from the western
mind, the Japanese liken to the accents of love. It
startled her for a second; then she began to sing,
under her breath, to the tune of her clacking <i style="text-shadow: none;">g�ta</i>,
a ditty of her childhood:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page102" id="page102" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span></p>

</tbody></table>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the crest of the hill, by the Street-of-Hollyhocks,
a wall opened in a huge gate of heavy burnished
beams studded with great iron rivet-heads.
Here resided no less a personage than an Imperial
Princess. Beside the gate stood a conical sentry-box,
in which all day, while the gate was open, stood
a soldier of the Household Guards. The box was
empty now.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Opposite the gate, a hedged lane opened, into
which she turned, and presently the song ceased.
She had come to the newly built Chapel. Her
father's name was on the household list of the temple
across the way, but she herself walked each Sunday
to Ts'kiji, to attend the bishop's Japanese service in
the Cathedral. When, influenced by a school-mate,
she had wished to become a Christian, the old <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i>
had interposed no objection. With the broad
tolerance of the esoteric Buddhist, to whom all pure
faiths are good, he had allowed her to choose for
herself. She had grown to love the strangely new
and beautiful worship with its singing, its service
in a tongue that she could understand, its Bible
filled with marvelous stories of old heroes, and with
vivid imagery like that of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kojiki</i>, the "Record
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page103" id="page103" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
of Ancient Matters" or the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Man-yoshu</i>, the "Collection
of a Myriad Leaves," over whose archaic characters
her father was always poring. She had ceased
to visit the temple, but otherwise the change had
made little difference in her placid life. With the
simplicity with which the Japanese of to-day kneels
with equal faith before a plain <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> shrine and a
golden altar of Buddha, she had continued the daily
home observances. Each morning she cleaned the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">butsu-dan</i>�refilled its tiny lamp with vegetable oil,
freshened its incense-cup and water bowl, and dusted
its golden shrine of Kwan-on which held the scroll
inscribed with the spirit names of a hundred ancestors,
and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">ihai</i>, or mortuary tablet, of her dead
mother. Though she no longer prayed before it, it
still signified to her the invisible haunting of the
dead�the continuing loving presence of that mother
who waited for her in the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Meidoland</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For many days Haru had watched the progress of
the Chapel building. The Cathedral was a good two
miles distant, but this was near her home; here she
would be able to attend more than the weekly Sunday
service. To-night, as she looked at the cross
shining in the moonlight, she thought it very beautiful.
A tiny symbol like it, made of white enamel,
was hung on a little chain about her neck. It had
been given her by the bishop the day of her confirmation.
She drew this out and swung it about her
finger as she walked on.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page104" id="page104" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
In the Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods were no huge
and gloomy compounds. It was a roadway of
humbler shops and homes, bordered with mazes of
lantern fire, and lively with pedestrians. At a
meager shop, pitifully small, whose <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> were wide
open, Haru paused. A smoky oil lamp swung from
the ceiling, and under its glow, a woman knelt on the
worn <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i>. Beside her, on a pillow, lay a newborn
baby, and she was soothing its slumber by softly
beating a tiny drum close to its ear. She nodded
and smiled to Haru's salutation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hai! Ojo-San</i>," she said. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Go kigen yo!</i> Deign
augustly to enter."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Honorable thanks," responded Haru, "but my
father awaits my unworthy return. <i style="text-shadow: none;">Domo! Aka-San
des'ka?</i> So this is Miss Baby! Ishikichi will
have a new comrade in this little sister."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Poison not your serene mind with contemplation
of my uncomely last-sent one!" said the woman,
pridefully tilting the pillow so as to show the tiny,
vacuous face. "Are not its hands degradedly well-formed?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Wonderfully beyond saying! The father is still
exaltedly ill?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is indeed so! I have not failed to sprinkle the
holy water over Jizo, nor to present the straw sandals
to the Guardians-of-the-Gate. Also I have
rubbed each day the breast of the health-god; yet
O-Binzuru does not harken. Doubtless it is because
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page105" id="page105" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
of some sin committed by my husband in a previous
existence! I have not knowledge of your Christian
God, or I would make my worthless sacrifices also
to Him."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He heals the sick," said Haru, "but He augustly
loves not sacrifice�as He exaltedly did in olden
time," she hastily supplemented, recalling certain
readings from the Old Testament.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The gods of Nippon divinely change not their
habit," returned the woman. "Also my vile intellect
can not comprehend why the foreigners' God should
illustriously concern Himself with the things of another
land."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Christian Divinity," said Haru, "is a God of
all lands and all peoples."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other mused. "It passes in my degraded mind
that He, then, would lack a sublime all-sympathy for
our Kingdom-of-Slender-Swords. You are transcendently
young, <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i>, but I am thirty-two, and
I hold by the gods of my ancestors."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Honorably present my greetings to your husband,"
Haru said, as she bowed her adieu. "May
his exalted person soon attain divine health! To-morrow
I will send another book for him to read."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The woman watched her go, with a smile on her
tired face�the Japanese smile that covers so many
things. She looked at the baby's face on the pillow.
"Praise <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shaka</i>," she said aloud, "there is millet yet
for another week. Then we must give up the shop.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page106" id="page106" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
Well�I can play the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>, and the gods are not
dead!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Behind her a diminutive figure had lifted himself
upright from a <i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>. He came forward from the
gloom, his single sleeping-robe trailing comically
and his great black eyes round and serious. "Why
must we give up the shop, honorable mother?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Go to sleep, Ishikichi," said his mother. "Trouble
me not so late with your rude prattle."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But why, <i style="text-shadow: none;">Okka-San</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Because rent-money exists not, small pigeon,"
she answered gently. "So long as we have ignobly
lived here, we have paid the <i style="text-shadow: none;">banto</i> who brings his
joy-giving presence on the first of each month. Now
we have no more money and can not pay."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why have we no more money?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Because the honorable father is sick and you are
too small to earn. But let it not trouble your heart,
for the gods are good. See�we have almost waked
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Aka-San</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She bent over the pillow and began again the elfin
drumming at the infant's ear. But Ishikichi lay
open-eyed on his <i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>, his baby mind grappling
with a new and painful wonder.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page107" id="page107" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXII" id="chXII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">IN THE STREET-OF-PRAYER-TO-THE-GODS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Haru</span> unlatched a gate across which twisted
a plum-branch with tarnished, silver bark.
It hid a garden so tiny that it was scarcely
more than a rounded boulder set in moss, with a
clump of golden <i style="text-shadow: none;">icho</i> shrubs. Across the path, high
in air, were stretched giant webs in whose centers
hung black spiders as big as Japanese sparrows.
Beyond was a low doorway, shaded by a gnarled <i style="text-shadow: none;">kiri</i>
tree. The thin, white rice-paper pasted behind the
bars of its sliding grill shone goldenly with the candle-light
within. She rang a bell which hung from
a cord.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hai-ai-ai-ai-ee!</i>" sounded a long-drawn voice
from within, and in a moment a little maid slid back
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> and bobbed over to the threshold.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her mistress stepped from her <i style="text-shadow: none;">g�ta</i> into the small
anteroom. Here the floor was covered with soft
<i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i>,�the thick, springy rice-straw mats which,
in Japan, play the part of carpets�and a bronze
vase on a low lacquer stool held a branch of dark
ground-pine and a single white lily. A voice was
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page108" id="page108" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
audible, reciting in a droning monotone. It
stopped suddenly and called Haru's name.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She answered instantly, and parting the panels,
passed into the next room, where her father sat on
his mat reading in the faint soft light of an <i style="text-shadow: none;">andon</i>.
He was an old man, with white head strongly
poised on gaunt shoulders. Broken in fortune and
in health, the spirit of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i> burned inextinguishably
in the fire of his sunken eyes. He
took her hand and drew her down beside him. She
knew what was in his mind.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Be no longer troubled," she said. "The American
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i> is as lovely as Ama-terasu, the Sun
Goddess, and as kind as she is beautiful. I shall be
happy to be each day with her."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is good," he said. "Yet I take no joy
from it. You are the last of a family that for a
thousand seasons has served none save its Emperor
and its <i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyo</i>."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am no servant," she answered quickly.
"Rather am I, in sort, a companion to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i>,
to offer her my tasteless conversation and somewhat
to go about with her in this unfamiliar city. It is
an honorable way of acquiring gain, and thus I
may unworthily pay my support, for which now
from time to time you are brought to sell the priceless
classics in which your soul exaltedly delights."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His face softened. "I have lived too long," he
said. "My hand is palsied�I, a two-sword man
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page109" id="page109" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
of the old clan! I should have died in the war,
fighting for Nippon and my Emperor. But even
then was I too dishonorably old! Why did not
the gods grant me a son?�me, who wearied them
with my sacrifices?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She did not answer for a moment. Nothing in
her cried out at this reiterated complaint, for she
was of the same blood. If she had been a son, that
wound in her father's heart had been healed.
Through her arm the family would have fought.
Her glorious death-name might even now be written
on an <i style="text-shadow: none;">ihai</i> on the Buddha-shelf, her glad soul
swelling the numbers of that ghostly legion whose
spiritual force was the true vitality of her nation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Perhaps that, too, might be," she said presently
in a low voice. "Should I augustly marry one not
of too exalted a station, he could receive adoption
into our family."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked into her deeply flushing face. "You
think of the Lieutenant Ishida H�taro," he said.
"It is true that the go-between has already deigned
to sit on my hard mats. He is, I think, in every
way worthy of our house. I would rather he were
in the field, with a sword in his hand�I know not
much of this 'Secret Service.' What are his present
duties? Doubtless"�with a spark of mischief in
his hollow, old eyes�"you are better informed
than I."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He is in the household of one named Bersonin,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page110" id="page110" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
a man-mountain like our wrestlers, whose service
Japan pays with a wage."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His seamed face clouded. "To cunningly watch
the foreigner's incomings and his outgoings, and
make august report to the Board of Extraordinary
Information," he said, with a trace of bitterness.
"To play the clod when one is all eyes and ears.
Honorable it is, no doubt, yet to my old palate
it savors too much of the actor strutting on
the circular stage. But times change, and if, to
live, we must ape the foreigners, why, we must
borrow their ways till such time�the gods grant it
be soon!�when we can throw them on the dust
heap. And what am I to set my debased ignorance
against my Princes and my Emperor!" He paused
a moment and sighed. "Ishida is well esteemed,"
he continued presently. "He has dwelt in America
and learned its tongue�a necessity, it seems, in
these topsy-turvy times. Yet, as for marriage,
waiting still must be. These are evil days for us,
my child. From whence would come the gifts which
must be sent before the bride, to the husband's
house? Your mother"�he paused and bowed
deeply toward the golden <i style="text-shadow: none;">butsu-dan</i>
in its alcove�"may
she rest on the lotos-terrace of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Amida</i>!�came
to my poor house with a train of coolies bearing
lacquer chests: silken <i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>, <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> as soft and
filmy as mist, gowns of cloth and of cotton, cushions
of gold and silver patternings, jeweled girdles,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page111" id="page111" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
velvet sandals and all lovely garniture. Shall her
daughter be sent to a husband with a chest of rags?
No, no!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She leaned her dark head against his blue-clad
shoulder and drew the scroll from his trembling
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wind your words about my heart," she said.
"Waiting is best. Perhaps the evil times will withdraw.
I have prayed to the Christian God concerning
it. But your eyes are augustly wearied. Let
me read to you a while."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He settled himself back on the mat, his gaunt
hands buried in his sleeves, and, snuffing the wick
in the <i style="text-shadow: none;">andon</i>, she began to read the archaic "grass-writing."
It was the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shundai Zatsuwa</i> of Kyuso
Moro.</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXIII" id="chXIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE WHORLS OF YELLOW DUST</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">For</span> a long time in her blue and white room
Barbara lay awake, listening to the incessant
chorus that came on the deepening mystery of
the dark: the rustle of the pine-needles outside her
window, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kiri-kiri-kiri-kiri</i> of a night-cricket on
the sill, and the wavering chant of a toiling coolie
keeping time to the thrust of his body as he hauled
his heavy cart. The shadow of a twisted pine-branch
crossed one of the windows, and in the
infiltering moonlight she could see the yellow gleam
of the gold-lacquer Buddha on the Sendai chest.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She could imagine it the same image she had
found as a little girl in the garret, and had made
her pet delight. For an instant she seemed to be
once more a child seated on her low stool before
it, her hands tight-clasped, looking up into its immobile
countenance, half-hoping, half-fearing those
carven lips would speak. On the wings of this
sensation came a childish memory of a day when
her aunt had found her thus and had thought her
praying to it. She remembered the look of frozen
horror on her aunt's face and her own helpless mortification.
For she did not know how to explain.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page114" id="page114" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
She had had to write a verse from the Bible fifty
times in her copybook:</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.</i></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And she had had to do half of them over because she
had forgotten the capital M. That day her treasure
had disappeared, and she had never seen it again.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The glimmering figure in the dark made her
think, too, of the man of whom Daunt had told her,
who shunned his own race, hiding himself for years
and years in a Japanese temple, with its painted
dragon carvings, glowing candles and smoking censers.
The incense from them seemed now to be
filling all the night with odors rich and alluring,
whispering of things mysterious and confined.
Striking across the lesser sounds she could hear
at intervals the flute of a blind <i style="text-shadow: none;">masseur</i>, and nearer,
in the Embassy grounds, the recurrent signal of a
patroling night watchman: three strokes of one
hard, wooden stick upon another, like a high, mellow
note of a xylophone.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">This sounded a little like a ship's bell�striking
on a white yacht, whose owner was visiting the
ancient capital, Nara. He would appear before long,
and she knew what he would say, and what he
would want her to say to him. She felt somehow
guilty, with a sorry though painless compunction.
The man on the steamer that morning had spoken
of a younger brother who was in Japan, "going the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page115" id="page115" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
pace." Phil�she had often heard Austen Ware
speak of him. Perhaps he had only come over to
keep the other out of mischief. She told herself this
a second time, because it gave her a drowsy satisfaction,
though she knew it was not so. She had always
pictured Phil as "fast," and she wondered sleepily
what the word meant here in the orient, where there
were no theater suppers, and where men probably
played <i style="text-shadow: none;">fan-tan</i>�no, that was Chinese�or some
other queer game instead of poker�unless they ... had a�roplanes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bell of the distant temple, which she had
heard in the garden, boomed softly, and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">amma's</i>
flute sounded again its piercing, plaintive double-note.
The two sounds began to weave together with
a sense of unreality, dreamy, occult, incommunicable.
So at length Barbara slept, fitfully, the fragments
of that lavish day falling into a bizarre mosaic,
in which strange figures mingled uncannily.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She knew them for visions, and to avoid them
climbed a grassy hill to a gray old temple in which
she saw her father seated cross-legged on a huge
lotos-flower. She knew him because his face was just
like the face in the locket she wore. She called out
and ran toward him, but it was only a great gold-lacquered
Buddha with candles burning around it.
She ran out of the temple, where a dog pursued
her and a monstrous man with a pallid face, who
sat in a tree full of cherry-blossoms, threw something
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page116" id="page116" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
at her which suddenly went off with a terrific
explosion and blew both him and the dog into
bits. It seemed terrible, but she could only laugh
and laugh, because somebody held her tight in his
arms and she knew that nothing could frighten her
ever any more.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And on the tide of this shy comfort she drifted
away at last upon a deep and dreamless sea.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Later, when the moon had set and only the faint
starlight lay over the garden, the Ambassador still
sat in his study, thoughtfully smoking a cigar. On
the mantel, under a glass case, was a model of a
battle-ship. Over it hung a traverse drawing of
the Panama Canal cuttings, and maps and framed
photographs looked from the walls between the
dark-toned book-shelves. The floor was covered
with a deep crimson rug of camel's-hair. The
shaded reading-lamp on the desk threw a bright
circle of light on an open volume of Treaties at his
elbow.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At length he rose, took up the lamp, and approached
the mantel. He stood a moment looking
thoughtfully at the model under its rounded glass.
It was built to scale, and complete in every exterior
detail, from the pennant at its head to the tiny black
muzzles that peeped from its open casemates. Two
years ago America had sent a fleet of such vessels
to circumnavigate the globe. An European Squadron
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page117" id="page117" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
of even deadlier type would cast anchor the
next morning in those waters. Yet now Bersonin's
phrase rang insistently through his mind: "Mere
silly shreds of steel!" It recurred like a refrain,
mixing itself with the expert's curious words in
the study, with that extraordinary incident of the
piazza�which had bred a stealthy mistrust that
would not down.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With the lamp in his hand he opened the door
into the hall and stood listening a moment. Save
for the creaks and snappings that haunt frame
structures in a land of rapid decay, the house was
still. He entered the drawing-room, noiselessly undid
the fastenings of a French window and stepped
out on to the piazza.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There he threw the lamplight about him, mentally
reconstructing the scene of two hours before.
Here he himself had stood, yonder Bersonin, and
in the corner the dog�ten feet from the edge of the
porch. It had vanished in the same instant that he
had seen it leaping straight at the expert. What
was it Bersonin had taken from his pocket? A
weapon? And <i style="text-shadow: none;">where had the hound gone</i>?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He stepped forward suddenly; the chair which
had been thrown by the Japanese boy had been set
upright, but beneath it, and on the piazza beyond,
disposed in curious wreaths and whorls, like those
made by steel filings above an electro-magnet, lay
a thick sifting of what looked like reddish-yellow
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page118" id="page118" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
dust. He stooped and took up some in his fingers;
it was dry and impalpable, of an extraordinary
fineness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He stood looking at it a full minute, intent with
some absorbed and disquieting communing. Then
he shook his broad shoulders, as though dismissing
an incredible idea, returned the lamp to the study
and went slowly up the stair to his room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But he was not sleeping when dawn came, gray
in the sky. It stole pink-fingered through the window
and drew rosy lights on the blank wall across
which strange fancies of his had linked themselves
in a weird processional. It crept between the heavy
curtains of the study below, and gilded the fittings
of the little battle-ship on the mantel�as though to
deck it in crimson bunting like its mammoth prototypes
in the lower bay.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For at that moment the Yokohama Bund was
throbbing with the <i style="text-shadow: none;">salvos</i> of great guns pealing
a salute. The water's edge was lined with a watching
crowd. Files of marines were drawn up beneath
the green-trimmed arches and cutters flying
the sun-flag lay at the wharf, where groups of
officers stood in dress-uniform.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Over the ledge of the morning was spread a
filmy curtain of damask rose, and beneath it, into
the harbor, like a broad dotted arrow-head, was
steaming a flock of black battle-ships, with inky
smoke pouring from their stacks.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page119" id="page119" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXIV" id="chXIV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">WHEN BARBARA AWOKE</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">When</span> Barbara awoke next morning she
lay for a moment staring open-eyed from
her big pillow at the white wall above,
where a hanging-shelf projected to guard the
sleeper from falling plaster in earthquake. The
room was filled with a soft light that filtered in
through the split-bamboo blinds. Then she remembered:
it was her first whole day in Japan.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She felt full of a gay <i style="text-shadow: none;">insouciance</i>, a glad lightness
of joy that she had never felt before. Slipping
a thin rose-colored robe over her nightgown,
she threw open the window and leaned out. The
air was as pure and clean as if it had been sieved
through silk, and she breathed it with long inspirations.
It made her think of the unredeemed dirt of
other countries, the sooty air of crowded factories,
hardly growing foliage and unlovely walls.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Embassy was a pretentious frame structure
in which frequent alterations had masked an original
plan. With its tall porte-coch�re, its long narrow
L which served as Chancery, the smaller
white cottage across the lawn occupied by the Secretary
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page120" id="page120" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
of Embassy, the rambling servants' quarters
and stables, it suggested some fine old Virginia
homestead, transported by Aladdin's genii to the
heart of an oriental garden. For the tiny rock-knoll,
with its single twisted pine-tree in front of the main
door, the wistaria arbor and red dwarf maples, the
great stone lanterns, the miniature lake and pebbled
rivulet spanned by its arching bridge�all these
were Japanese. In the early morning the eerie
witchery of the night was gone, but the sky was as
deep as space and the air languid with the perfume
and warmth of a St. Martin's summer. A green-golden
glow tinged the camelia hedges and above
them the long cool expanse of weather-boarding
and olive blinds�like a carving in jade and old
ivory.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she stood there bathed in the sunlight, her
hands dividing the curtains, Barbara made a gracious
part of the glimmering setting. Her thick,
ruddy hair sprang curling from her strongly
modeled forehead, and fell about her white shoulders,
a warm reddish mass against the delicately
tinted curtain. There was a thoroughbred straightness
in the lines of the tall figure, in the curve of the
cheek and the round directness of the chin; and
her eyes, bent on the lucent green, were the color
of brown sea-water under sapphire cloud-shadows.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From  a circle of evergreens near the porte-coch�re
a white flag-pole rose high above the treetops.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page121" id="page121" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
The stars-and-stripes floated from its halyards,
for the day was the national holiday of an
European power. In the hedges sparrows were
twittering, and in a plum-tree a <i style="text-shadow: none;">uguisu</i>�the little
Buddhist bird that calls the sacred name of the
Sutras�was warbling his sweet, slow, solemn syllables:
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ho-kek-yo! Ho-kek-yo!</i>" A gardener was
sweeping the pink rain of cherry-petals from the
paths with a twig broom, the long sleeves of his blue
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> fluttering in the yellow sunshine, and in
front of the servants' quarters a little girl in flapping
sandals was skipping rope with a chenille fascinator.
Beyond the wall of the compound Barbara could see
the street, a low row of open shops. In one, a number
of men and girls, sitting on flat mats, were
making bamboo fans. At the corner stood a
round well, from which a group of women, barefooted
and with tucked-up clothing, were drawing
water in unpainted wooden buckets with polished
brass hoops, and beside it, under a dark blue awning,
a man and woman were grinding rice in a hand-mill
made of two heavy stone disks. A blue-and-white
figured towel was bound about the woman's
head against the fine white rice-dust. Above them,
on a tiny portico, an old man, with the calm, benevolent
face of a porcelain mandarin, was watering an
unbelievably-twisted dwarf plum on which was a
single bunch of blossoming. At the side of the
street grew a gnarled <i style="text-shadow: none;">kiri</i> tree, its shambling roots
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page122" id="page122" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
encroaching on the roadway. In their cleft was set
a wooden <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> shrine with small piles of pebbles
before it. From a distance, high and clear, she
heard a strain of bugles from some squad of soldiers
going to barracks, or perhaps to the parade-ground,
where, she remembered, an Imperial Review of
Troops was to be held that morning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara started suddenly, to see on the lawn just
below her window, a figure three feet high, with a
round, cropped head, gazing at her from a solemn,
inquiring countenance. He wore a much-worn but
clean <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, and his infantile toes clutched the
thongs of clogs so large that his feet seemed to be
set on spacious wooden platforms. The youngster
bent double and staggeringly righted himself with
a staccato "<i style="text-shadow: none;">O-hayo!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara gave an inarticulate gasp; in face of his
somber dignity she did not dare to laugh. "How
do you do?" she said. "Do you live here?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No," he replied. "I lives in a other houses."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh!" exclaimed Barbara, aghast at his command
of English. "What is your name?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ishikichi," he said succinctly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And will you tell me what you are doing, Ishikichi?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A small hand from behind his back produced a
tiny bamboo cage in which was a bell-cricket. As
he held it out, the insect chirped like an elfin cymbal.
"Find more one," he said laconically.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page123" id="page123" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
"And what shall you do with them, I wonder."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He took one foot from its clog and wriggled bare
toes in the grass. "Give him to new little sister,"
he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So you have a new little sister!" exclaimed Barbara.
"How fine that must be!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A glaze of something like disappointment spread
over the diminutive face. "Small like," he said.
"More better want a brother to play with me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Maybe you might exchange her for a brother,"
she hazarded, but the cropped head shook despondently:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I think no can now," he said. "We have use
her four days."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara laughed outright, a peal of silvery sound
that echoed across the garden�then suddenly drew
back. A man on horseback was passing across the
drive toward the main gate of the compound. It
was Daunt, bareheaded, his handsome tanned face
flushed with exercise, the breeze ruffling his moist,
curling hair. She flashed him a smile as his riding-crop
flew to his brow in salute. The sun glinted
from its Damascene handle, wrought into the long,
grotesque muzzle of a fox. Between the edges of
the blue silk curtains she saw him turn in the saddle
to look back before he disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She stood peering out a long time toward the
low white cottage across the clipped lawn. The
laughter had left her eyes, and gradually over her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page124" id="page124" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
face grew a wave of rich color. She dropped the
curtain and caught her hands to her cheeks. For
an instant she had seemed to feel the pressure of
strong arms, the touch of coarse tweed vividly reminiscent
of a pipe.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">What had come over her? The one day that had
dawned at sea in golden fire and died in crimson
and purple over a file of convicts�the dreaming
night with its temple bell striking through silver
mist and violet shadows�these had left her the
same Barbara that she had always been. But somewhere,
somehow, in the closed gulf between the then
and now, something new and strange and sweet had
waked in her�something that the sound of a voice
in the garish sunlight had started into clamorous
reverberations.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She sat down suddenly and hid her face.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page125" id="page125" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXV" id="chXV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">A FACE IN THE CROWD</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">They</span> rode to the parade-ground�Barbara
and Patricia with the Ambassador, behind his
pair of Kentucky grays�along wide streets
grown festive overnight and buzzing with <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>
and pedestrians. Every gateway held crossed flags
bearing the blood-red rising-sun, and colored paper
lanterns were swung in festoons along the gaudy
blocks of shops, as wide open as tiers of cut honeycomb.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In their swift flight the city appeared a living sea
of undulations, of immense green wastes alternating
with humming sections of trade, of abrupt, cliff-like
hills, of small parks that were masses of cherry-bloom
and landscapes of weird Japanese beauty.
Patricia quoted one of Haru's quaint sayings:
"So-o-o many small village got such a lonesomeness
an' come more closer together. Tha's the way
Tokyo born." Occasionally the Ambassador
pointed out the stately palace of some influential
noble, or the amorphous, depressing front of the
foreign-style stucco residence of some statesman,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page126" id="page126" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;126]</span>
built in that different period when the empire took
first steps in the path of world-powers, with its low,
graceful Japanese portion beside it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Everywhere Barbara was conscious of the flutter
of children�of little girls whose dress and hair
showed a pervasive sense of care and adornment;
of faces neither gay nor sad looking from latticed
windows that hung above open gutters of sluggish
ooze; of frail balconies adorned with growing flowers
or miniature gardens set in earthen trays; of
doorways hung with soft-fringed, rice-straw ropes
and dotted with paper charms�the talismanic
<i style="text-shadow: none;">o-fuda</i> seen on every hand in Japan. In Yokohama
what had struck her most had been the curious composite,
the jumbled dissonance of East and West.
Here was a new impression; this was real Japan, but
a Japan that, if it had taken on western hues, had
everywhere qualified them by subtle variations, themselves
oriental. Past the carriage whirled landaus
bearing Japanese <i style="text-shadow: none;">grandes dames</i> in native dress,
with pomade-stiff coiffures against which their rice-powdered
faces made a ghastly contrast; between
the rear springs of each vehicle was fixed a round
flat pommel on which a runner stood, balancing
himself to the swift movement. A Japanese military
officer in khaki, with a row of decorations on
his breast, rode by on a horse too big for him, at
a jingling trot. Two soldiers passing afoot, faced
sidewise and their heavy cowhide heels came together
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page127" id="page127" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
with a thud, as they saluted. Their arms
had the jerky precision of a mechanical toy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Through all there seemed to Barbara to strike a
sense of the tenacity of the old, of the stubborn
persistence of type, as though eyes behind a mask
looked grimly at the mirror's reflection of some outlandish
and but half-accustomed masquerade. It
was the shadow of the old Japan of castes and spies
and censors, of homage and <i style="text-shadow: none;">hara-kiri</i>, of punctilio
and porcelain. Trolley cars rumbled past; skeins of
telegraph wire spun across the vision. Yet when
stone wall gaped or green hedge opened, it was to
reveal the curving tops of Buddhist <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i> in quaint
vistas of straight-boled trees, gliding Tartar contours
of roof between clumps of palm, or bamboo
thickets with shadows as black as ink; while from
the lazy scum of the wide, moat-like, stone gutters,
open to the all-putrefying sun, rose thick, marshy
odors suggesting the vast languor of a land more
ancient than Egypt and Nineveh.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The carriage stopped abruptly at a cross street.
A <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> funeral <i style="text-shadow: none;">cort�ge</i> was passing. Twelve
bearers, six on each side, clad in mourning <i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i> of
pure white, bore on their shoulders the hearse, like
a shrine, built of clean unpainted wood, beautifully
grained, and with carven roof and curtains of green
and gold brocade. Priests in yellow robes, with
curved gauze caps and stoles of scarlet and black,
walked at the head, fanning themselves now and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page128" id="page128" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
then with little fans drawn from their girdles.
Coolies, dressed in white like the hearse bearers,
carried stiff, conical bouquets, six feet long, made
of flowers of staring colors, and clumps of lotos
made of <i style="text-shadow: none;">papier mach�</i> covered with gold and silver
leaf. The chief mourner, a woman, rode smiling in
a <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>. She wore a silver-gray <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> and a
tall canopied cap of white brocade with wide floating
strings like an old-fashioned bonnet.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, of all things!" said Patricia, in an awe-struck
whisper. "What do you think of that?" For
the file of <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> following her carried a curious
assemblage of mourners. In each sat a dog,
some large, some small, with great bows of black
or white crepe tied to their collars. Taka, the
driver, turned his head and spoke:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Dog-doctor die," he said. "All dog very sorry."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's the 'vet.,' father," Patricia cried. "He is
dead, then�and all his old patients are attending
the funeral! See, Barbara! They are lined up according
to diplomatic precedence. That French
poodle in front belongs to the Japanese senior
prince. The Aberdeen is the British Ambassador's.
And there's the Italian Embassy bull-terrier and the
Spanish <i style="text-shadow: none;">Charg�'s</i> 'chin.' The foreigners' dogs have
black bows and the others white. Why is that, I
wonder?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I presume," said the Ambassador, "because
white is the Japanese mourning color."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page129" id="page129" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
"Of course. How stupid of me!" She sat suddenly
upright. "Of all <i style="text-shadow: none;">things</i>! There's our
'Dandy'!" She pointed to a tiny Pomeranian on
the seat of the last <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>. "I wondered why
number-three boy was washing him so hard this
morning! It's a mercy he didn't see us, or he'd
have broken up the procession. Please take note
that he's the tail-end�which shows my own unofficial
insignificance."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There's a tourist at the hotel," said the Ambassador,
"who should have seen this. I was there the
other day and I overheard her speaking to one of the
Japanese clerks. She said she had seen everything
but a funeral, and she wanted him to instruct her
guide to take her to one. The clerk said: 'I am too
sorry, Madam, but this is not the season for
funerals.'"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The horses trotted on, to drop to a walk, presently,
on a brisk incline. High, slanting retaining
walls were on either side, and double rows of
cherry-trees, whose interlacing branches wove a
roof of soft pink bloom. Along the road were many
people; <i style="text-shadow: none;">inkyo</i>�old men who no longer labored, and
<i style="text-shadow: none;">ba-San</i>�old women whom age had relieved from
household cares�bent and withered and walking
with staves or leaning on the arms of their daughters,
who bore babies of their own strapped to their
backs; children clattering on loose wooden clogs;
youths sauntering with <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono'd</i> arms thrown, college-boy
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page130" id="page130" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
fashion, about each other's shoulders; a
troop of young girls in student <i style="text-shadow: none;">hakama</i>�skirts of
deep purple or garnet�laughing and chatting in low
voices or airily swinging bundles tied in colored
<i style="text-shadow: none;">furoshiki</i>. Midway the wall opened into a miniature
park filled with trees, with a small lake and a <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i>
monument.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why, there's little Ishikichi," said Patricia.
"I never saw him so far from home before. Isn't
that a queer-looking man with him!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The solemn six-year-old, Barbara's window acquaintance
of the morning, was trotting from the
inclosure, his small fingers clutching the hand of a
foreigner. The latter was of middle age. His coat
was a heavy, double-breasted "reefer." His battered
hat, wide-brimmed and soft-crowned, was a
joke. But his linen was fresh and good and his
clumsy shoes did not conceal the smallness and
shapeliness of his feet. He was lithe and well built,
and moved with an easy swing of shoulder and
a step at once quick and graceful. His back was
toward them, but Barbara could see his long, gray-black
hair, a square brow above an aquiline profile
at once bold and delicate, and a drooping mustache
shot with gray. Many people seemed to regard
him, but he spoke to no one save his small companion.
His manner, as he bent down, had something
caressing and confiding.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the sound of wheels the man turned all at once
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page131" id="page131" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
toward them. As his gaze met Barbara's, she
thought a startled look shot across it. At side
view his face had seemed a dark olive, but now
in the vivid sunlight it showed blanched. His eyes
were deep in arched orbits. One, she noted, was
curiously prominent and dilated. From a certain
bird-like turn of the head, she had an impression
that this one eye was nearly if not wholly sightless.
All this passed through her mind in a flash,
even while she wondered at his apparent agitation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For as he gazed, he had dropped the child's hand.
She saw his lips compress in an expression grim and
forbidding. He made an involuntary movement,
as though mastered by a quick impulse. Then,
in a breath, his face changed. He shrank back,
turned sharply into the park and was lost among
the trees.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What an odd man!" exclaimed Patricia. "I
suppose he resented our staring at him. He's left
the little chap all alone, too. Stop the horses a moment,
Tucker," she directed, and as they pulled up
she called to the child.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But there was no reply. Ishikichi looked at her
a moment frowningly, then, without a word, turned
and stalked somberly after his companion.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What an infant thunder-cloud!" said Patricia as
the carriage proceeded. "That must be where our
precious prodigy gets his English. Poor mite!" she
added. "He was the inseparable of the son of Toru,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page132" id="page132" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
the flower-dealer opposite the Embassy, Barbara,
and the dear little fellow was run over and killed last
week by a foreign carriage. No doubt he's grieving
over it, but in Japan even the babies are trained not
to show what they feel. I wonder who this new
friend is?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I've seen the man once before," said the Ambassador.
"He was pointed out to me. His name is
Thorn. His first name is Greek�Aloysius, isn't
it?�yes, Aloysius. He is a kind of recluse: one
of those bits of human flotsam, probably, that western
civilization discards, and that drift eventually
to the East. It would be interesting to know his
history."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">So this, thought Barbara, was the exile of whom
Daunt had told her, who had chosen to bury himself�from
what unguessed motive!�in an oriental
land, sunk out of sight like a stone in a pool. When
he looked at her she had felt almost an impulse to
speak, so powerfully had the shadow in his eyes
suggested the canker of solitariness, the dreary ache
of bitterness prolonged. She felt a wave of pity
surging over her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the carriage leaped forward, new sights
sprang on them and the fleeting thought dropped
away at length behind her, with the overhanging
cherry-blooms, the little green park, and the strange
face at its gateway.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page133" id="page133" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXVI" id="chXVI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">"BANZAI NIPPON!"</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Gradually</span>, as they proceeded, the throng
became denser. Policemen in neat suits of
white-duck and wearing long cavalry swords
lined the road. They had smart military-looking
caps and white cotton gloves, and stood, as had the
officer before the file of convicts in Shimbashi Station,
moveless and imperturbable. The crowds were
massed now in close, locked lines on either side. In
one place a school-master stood guard over a file of
small boys in holiday <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>: a little paper Japanese
flag was clutched in each chubby hand.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In all the ranks there was no jostling, or fighting
for position, no loud-voiced jest or expostulation;
a spell was in the air; the Imperial Presence who
was to pass that way had cast His beneficent
Shadow before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Through a double row of saluting police they
whirled into an immense brown field, as level as a
floor, stretching before them seemingly empty, a
dull, yellow-brown waste horizoned by feathery
tree-tops. The carriage turned to the right, skirting
a surging sea of brown faces held in check by
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page134" id="page134" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
a stretched rope; these gave place to a mass of
officers standing in dress-uniform, with plumed caps
and breasts ablaze with decorations; in another moment
they descended before a canvas <i style="text-shadow: none;">marqu�e</i> where
brilliant regimental uniforms from a dozen countries
shifted and mingled with diplomatic costumes
heavy with gold-braid, and with women's gay frocks
and picture-hats.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The air was full of exhilaration; people were
laughing and chatting. The British Ambassador
displayed the plaid of a Colonel of Highlanders;
he had fought in the Soudan. The Chinese Minister
was in his own mandarin costume; from his
round, jade-buttoned hat swept the much coveted
peacock feathers and on his breast were the stars of
the "Rising-Sun" and the "Double-Dragon." The
American Ambassador alone, of all the foreign representatives,
wore the plain frock-coat and silk hat
of the civilian. From group to group strolled officials
of the Japanese Foreign Office and Cabinet Ministers,
their ceremonial coats crossed by white or
crimson cordons. And through it all Barbara
moved, responsive to all this lightness and color,
bowing here and there to introductions that left her
only the more conscious of the one tall figure that
had met them and now walked at her side.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt could not have told that the flowers in her
hat were brown orchids: he only knew that they
matched the color of her eyes. Last night the moonlight
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page135" id="page135" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
had lent her something of the fragile and
ethereal, like itself. Now the sunlight painted in
clear warm colors of cream and cardinal. It glinted
from the perfect curve of her forehead, and tangled
in the wide wave of her bronze hair, making it
gleam like hot copper spun into silk-fine strands.
His finger-tips tingled to touch it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He started, as�"A penny for your thoughts,"
she said, with sudden mischief.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Have you so much about you?" he countered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That's a subterfuge."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You wouldn't be flattered to hear them, I'm
afraid."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The reflection is certainly a sad blow to my self-esteem!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well," he said daringly, "I was thinking how I
would like to pick you up in my arms before all
these people and run right out in the center of that
field�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She flushed to the tips of her ears. "And then�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Just run, and run, and run away."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What a heroic exploit!" she said with subtle
mockery, but the flush deepened.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You know to what lengths I can go in my longing
to be a hero!" he muttered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Running off with girls under your arm seems
to have become a mania. But isn't your idea rather
prosaic in this age of flying-machines? To swoop
down on one in an a�roplane would be so much
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page136" id="page136" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
more thrilling! This is the field where you practise,
too, isn't it? Is that building away over there
where you keep your Glider?"'</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. At first I made the models in a Japanese
house of mine near here. I keep it still, from sentiment."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How fine to meet a man who admits to having
sentiment! I'm tremendously interested in Japanese
houses. You must show it to me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I will. And when will you let me take you for
a 'fly?'"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm relieved," she said, "to find you willing to
ask permission."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her eyes sparkled into his, and both laughed.
Patricia was chatting animatedly with Count Voynich,
the young diplomatist whom she had pointed
out in the train, and whose monocle now looked
absurdly contemplative and serene under a menacing
helmet. The confusion of many colors, the pomp
and panoply under the day's golden azure, was singing
in Barbara's veins. She moved suddenly toward
the front. "Come," she said, "I want you to tell me
things!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm going to," he answered grimly. "I've
known I should, ever since�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Look!" she cried. Several coaches had bowled
up; behind each stood footmen in gold-lace and
cocked hats, knee breeches and white silk stockings.
Daunt named the occupants as they descended: the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page137" id="page137" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
Premier, one of the "Elder Statesmen," the Minister
of the Household.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Who are the people there at the side, under the
awning?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Tourists. Each Embassy and Legation is allowed
a certain number of invitations."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why, yes," said Barbara. "I see some of my
ship-mates." She smiled and nodded across as
faces turned toward her. There was the gaunt,
sallow woman who had distributed Christian Science
tracts (till sea-sickness claimed her for its
own) and little Miss Tippetts (the printed steamer-list,
with unconscious wit, had made it "Tidbits"),
who had flitted about the companion-ways like a
shawled wraith, radiant now in a white <i style="text-shadow: none;">lingerie</i>
gown and a hat covered with red hollyhocks. And
there, too, was the familiar painted-muslin and the
expansive white waistcoat of the train.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A hundred yards to the right was spread a wide
silk canopy of royal purple, caught back with crimson
tassels. "What is that?" Barbara asked, pointing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is for the Emperor and his suite. The big
sixteen-petaled chrysanthemum on its front is the
Imperial Crest; no one else is allowed to use or
carry it. The men on horseback are Princes of the
Blood. Almost all the great generals of the late
war are in that group behind them. The man smoking
a cigarette is the Japanese Minister of War."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page138" id="page138" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
"But when do the troops come?" Barbara inquired.
"I see only one little company out there
in the center."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is a band," he said. "Look farther. Can
you make out something like a wide, brown ribbon
stretched all around the field?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked. The far-away, moveless, dun-colored
strip merged with the sere plain, but now, here and
there, she saw minute needle points of sunlight
twinkle across it. She made an exclamation. For
the tiny flashes were sun-gleams from the bayonets
of massed men, clad in neutral-tinted khaki,
silent, motionless as a brown wall, a living river
frozen to utter immobility by a word of command
that had been spoken two long hours before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A mounted <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> galloped wildly past toward the
purple canopy. As he flashed by, a thin bugle-note
rang out and a band far back by the gate at which
they had entered began playing a minor melody.
Strange, slow, infinitely solemn and sad, the strain
rolled around the hushed field�the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kimi-ga-yo</i>, the
"Hymn of the Sovereign," adapted by a German
melodist a score of years ago, which in Japan is
played only in the Imperial Presence or that of its
outward and visible tokens. The counterpoint, with
its muttering roll of snare-drums on the long chords,
and sudden, sharp clashes of cymbals, gave the majestic
air an effect weird and unforgetable. The
strain sank to silence, but with the last note a second
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page139" id="page139" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
nearer band caught it up and repeated it; then,
nearer still, another and another.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara, leaning, saw a great state-coach of green
and gold coming down the field. It was drawn by
four of the most beautiful bay horses she had ever
seen. Coachman, postilions and footmen wore red
coats heavily frogged with gold, white cloth
breeches and block enamel top-boots. As it came
briskly along that animate wall of spectators, the
vast concourse, save for the welling or ebbing minor
of the bands, was silent, hushed as in a cathedral.
But as it passed, the packed sea of brown faces�the
mass of <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> next the gate and the ranks of
splendid uniforms�bent forward as one man, in a
great sighing rustle, like a field of tall grass when
a sudden wind passes over it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The plumed hats of the diplomatists came off;
they bowed low. The ladies courtesied, and Barbara,
as her gaze lifted, caught an instant's glimpse,
through the coach's glass sides, of that kingly figure,
heaven-descended and sacred, mysterious alike to
his own subjects as to the outside world, through
whom flows to the soul of modern Japan the manifest
divinity and living guidance of cohorts of dead
Emperors stretching backward into the night of
Time!</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The band stationed in the center of the immense
field had begun to play�something with a martial
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page140" id="page140" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
swing; and now the far brown strip that had blent
with brown earth began to shift and tremble like
the quiver of air above heated metal. Its motes detached
themselves, clustered anew; and the long,
wide ribbon, like a huge serpent waked from rigid
sleep in the sunshine, swept into view: regiments
of men, armed and blanketed, by file and platoon.
They moved with high, jerky "goose-step" and
loosely swinging arm, line upon line, till the ground
shook with the tread.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Before each regiment were borne strange flags,
blackened and tattered by blood and shell. Some
were mere flapping fringes. But they were more
precious than human lives. One had been found on
a Manchurian battlefield, wrapped about the body
of a dead Japanese, beneath his clothing. Wounded,
he had so concealed it, then killed himself, lest, captured
alive, the standard he bore might fall into the
hands of the enemy. As each new rank came opposite
the coach before the purple canopy, an officer's
sword flashed out in salute, and a "<i style="text-shadow: none;">banzai!</i>"
tore across the martial music like the ragged yell
of a fanatical Dervish.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt, watching Barbara, saw the light leaping
in her brown eyes, the excitement coming and going
in her face. Again and again he fixed his gaze
before him, as infantry, cavalry and artillery
marched and pounded and rumbled past. In vain.
Like a wilful drunkard it returned to intoxicate itself
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page141" id="page141" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
with the sight of her eager beauty, that made
the scene for him only a splendid blur, an extraneous
impression of masses of swaying bodies moving like
marionettes, of glistening bayonets, horses, clattering
ammunition wagons, and fluttering pennants.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In Barbara, however, every nerve was thrilling
to the sight. For the moment she had forgotten
even the man beside her. As she watched the
audacious outpouring of drilled power, tempered
and restrained, yet so terribly alive in its coiled
virility, she was feeling a keen pang of sympathy
that was almost pain. In this burning panorama
she divined no shrinking, devious thing sinking with
the fatigue of ages, aping the superficialities of a
remote race: not merely a tidal wave of intense
vitality, mobile and mercurial, hastening onward
toward an inaudible unknown, but a splendid rebirth,
a dazzling reincarnation of old spirit in new form,
a symbol concrete and vital, like the blaze of a beacon
flaming a racial <i style="text-shadow: none;">r�veille</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned toward Daunt, her hand outstretched,
her fingers on his arm, her lips opened.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But she did not speak. Afterward she did not
know what she had intended to say.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page142" id="page142" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span></p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">A SILENT UNDERSTANDING</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil</span> descended from his <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> at the Tokyo
Club and paid the coolie.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The building faced an open square between
the Imperial Hotel and the Parliament Buildings,
along one of the smaller picturesque moats, which
the fever for modernization was now filling in to
make a conventional boulevard. A motor shed stood
at the side of the plaza and an automobile or two was
generally in evidence. The structure was small but
comfortable enough, with reading- and card-rooms
and a billiard-room of many tables. It was the
clearing-house for the capital's news, the general
exchange for Diet, Peers' Club and the Embassies.
It was a place of tacit free-masonry and conversational
dissections. From five to seven in the afternoon
it was a polyglot babble of Japanese, English,
French, German and Italian, punctuated with the
tinkle of glasses and the cheerful click of billiard
balls. Over its tables secretaries met to gossip of
the newest <i style="text-shadow: none;">entente</i> or the latest social "affair," and
<i style="text-shadow: none;">protocols</i> had been drafted on the big, deep, leather
sofas adjoining the bar.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page143" id="page143" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
The door was opened by a servile bell-boy in buttons.
Phil tossed his hat on to the hall-rack and entered.
It was cool and pleasant inside, and a great
bowl of China asters sat on the table beside the
membership book. On the wall was a wire frame
full of visitors' cards. He strode through the office
and entered a large, glass-inclosed piazza where a
number of Japanese, some in foreign, some in native
costume, were watching a game of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Go</i>. Two
younger Legation <i style="text-shadow: none;">attach�s</i> were shaking dice at another
table. It was but a little past noon and the
place had an air of sober quiet, very different, Phil
reflected, from the club on the Yokohama Bund,
which was always buzzing, and where he was hail-fellow-well-met
with everybody. Frowning, he
passed into the next room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Here his eye lightened. Sitting in a corner of
one of the huge sofas which sank under his enormous
weight, was Doctor Bersonin. A little round
table was before him on which sat a tall glass frosted
with cracked ice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Sit down," said the expert. "How do you come
to be in Tokyo? The Review, I presume." He
struck a call-bell on the table and gave an order to
the waiter.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil lighted a cigarette. "No," he said, "I've
come to stay for a while."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You haven't given up your bungalow on the
Bluff?" asked Bersonin quickly. There was an odd
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page144" id="page144" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
eagerness in his colorless face�a look of almost
dread, which Phil, lighting his cigarette, did not see.
It changed to relief as the other answered:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No. Probably I shan't be here more than a few
days."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The expert settled back in his seat. "You'll not
find the hotel everything it should be, I'm afraid,"
he observed more casually.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm not there," Phil answered. "I�I've got a
little Japanese house."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So! A <i style="text-shadow: none;">m�nage de gar�on</i>, eh?" The big man
held up his clinking glass to the light, and under
cover of it, his deep-set yellowish eyes darted a keen,
detective look at Phil's averted face. "Well," he
went on, "how are your affairs? Has the stern
brother appeared yet?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil shifted uneasily. "No," he replied. "I expect
him pretty soon, though." He drained the glass
the boy had filled. "You've been tremendously kind,
Doctor," he went on hurriedly, "to lend me so much,
without the least bit of security�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pshaw!" said Bersonin. "Why shouldn't I?" He
put his hand on the other's shoulder with a friendly
gesture. "I only wish money could give me as much
pleasure as it does you, my boy."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Two men had seated themselves in the next room.
Through the open door came fragments of conversation,
the gurgle of poured liquid and the bubbling
hiss of Hirano mineral water. Bersonin lowered his
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page145" id="page145" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
voice: "Youth! What a great thing it is! Red-blood
and imagination and zest to enjoy. All it
needs is the wherewithal to gild its pleasures. After
a time age catches us, and what are luxuries then?
Only things to make tiresomeness a little less irksome!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil moved his glass on the table top in sullen circles.
"But suppose one hasn't the 'wherewithal' you
talk of? What's the fun without money, even when
you're young? I've never been able to discover it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Find the money," said Bersonin.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wish some one would tell me how!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin's head turned toward the door. He sat
suddenly rigid. It came to Phil that he was listening
intently to the talk between the two men in the
next room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I needn't point out"�it was a measured voice,
cold and incisive and deliberate�"that when the
American fleet came, two years ago, conditions were
quite different. The cruise was a national <i style="text-shadow: none;">tour de
force</i>; the visit to Japan was incidental. Besides,
there was really no feeling then between the two nations�that
was all a creation of the yellow press.
But the coming of this European Squadron to-day
is a different thing. It is a season of general sensitiveness
and distrust, and when the ships belong to a
nation between which and Japan there is real and
serious diplomatic tension�well, in my opinion the
time is, at best, inopportune."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page146" id="page146" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
"Perhaps"�a younger voice was speaking now,
less certain, less poised and a little hesitant�"perhaps
the very danger makes for caution. People are
particularly careful with matches when there's a lot
of powder about."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"True, so far as intention goes. But there is the
possibility of some <i style="text-shadow: none;">contre-temps</i>. You remember the
case of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ajax</i> in the Eighties. It was blown up in
a friendly harbor�clearly enough by accident, at
least so far as the other nation was concerned. But it
was during a time of strain and hot blood, and you
know how narrowly a great clash was averted. If
war had followed, regiments would have marched
across the frontier, shouting: 'Remember the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ajax</i>!'
As it was, there was a panic in three bourses. Solid
securities fell to the lowest point in their history.
The yellow press pounded down the market, and a
few speculators on the short side made gigantic fortunes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A moment's pause ensued. Bersonin's fingers
were rigid. There seemed suddenly to Phil to be
some significance between his silence and the conversation�as
if he wished it to sink into his, Phil's,
mind. The voice continued:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What has happened once may happen again.
What if one of those Dreadnaughts by whatever accident
should go down in this friendly harbor? It
doesn't take a vivid imagination to picture the headlines
next morning in the newspapers at home!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page147" id="page147" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
The ice in the tumblers clinked; there was a sound
of pushed-back chairs.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As their departing footsteps died in the hall, Bersonin's
gaze lifted slowly to Phil's face. It had in it
now the look it had held when he gazed from the
roof of the bungalow on the Bluff across the anchorage
beneath. Phil did not start or shrink. Instead,
the slinking evil that ruled him met half-way the
bolder evil in that glance, from whose sinister suggestion
the veil was for a moment lifted, recognizing
a tacit kinship. Neither spoke, but as the hard young
eyes looked into the cavernous, topaz eyes of Doctor
Bersonin, Phil <i style="text-shadow: none;">knew</i> that the thought that lay coiled
there was a thing unholy and unafraid. His heart
beat faster, but it warmed. He felt no longer awed
by the other's greater age, standing and accomplishments.
He was conscious of a new, half-insolent
sense of easy comradeship.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Suppose," said Bersonin slowly, "I should show
you how to find the money."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A sharp eagerness darted across Phil's face.
Money! How much he needed it, longed for it! It
could put him on his feet, clear off his debts, square
his bridge-balance, and�his brother notwithstanding!�enable
him to begin another chapter of the
careless life he loved! He looked steadily into the
expert's face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Tell me!" he almost whispered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page148" id="page148" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
Bersonin rose and held out his hand. He did not
smile.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Come with me to-night," he said. "I dine late,
but we'll take a spin in my car and have some tea
somewhere beforehand. Tell me where your house
is and I'll send Ishida with the motor-car for you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil gave him the address and he went out with
no further word. A great, brass-fitted automobile,
with a young, keen-eyed Japanese sitting beside the
chauffeur, throbbed up from the shed. Bersonin
climbed ponderously in. A gray-haired diplomatist,
entering the Club with a stranger, pointed the big
man out to the other as he was whirled away.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page149" id="page149" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXVIII" id="chXVIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">IN THE BAMBOO LANE</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">What</span> did Bersonin mean?</i> Phil replenished
his glass, feeling a tense, nervous excitement.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Why had he listened so intently�made <i style="text-shadow: none;">him</i> listen�to
what the men in the next room were saying?
He could recall it all�for some reason every word
was engraven on his mind. The visit of the foreign
Squadron. Speculators who had once made quick
fortunes through an accident to a battle-ship. He
thought of the look he had seen on Bersonin's face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What do you want me to do?" He muttered the
words to himself. As he rose to go he glanced half-fearfully
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He walked along the street, his brain afire. He
was passing a moat in whose muck bottom piling
was being driven; the heavy plunger was lifted by
a dozen ropes pulled by a ring of coolie women,
dressed like men, with blue-cotton leggins and red
cloths about their heads. As they dragged at the
straw ropes, and the great weight rose and fell, they
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page150" id="page150" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;150]</span>
chanted a wailing refrain, with something minor
and plaintive in its burden�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Y��eeya�k��ra!
Y�-eeya�k��ra!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">What do you want me to do?...</i> The words
wove oddly with the refrain. Why should he say
them over and over? Again and again it came�an
echo of an echo�and again and again he seemed
to see the look in the expert's hollow, cat-like eyes!
It haunted him as he walked on toward Aoyama
parade-ground, to the little house in <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kasumigatani
Cho</i>, the "Street-of-the-Misty-Valley."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Then, as he walked, he saw some one that for the
moment drove it from his mind. He had turned for
a short-cut through a temple inclosure, and there he
met her face to face�the girl of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">matsuri</i>, whom
he had seen wading in the foam at Kamakura. Her
slim neck, pale with rice-powder, rose from a soft
white neckerchief flowered with gold, and a scarlet
poppy was dreaming in her black hair. Phil's face
sprang red, and a wave of warm color overran her
own.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">O-Haru-San!</i>" he cried.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Konichi-wa</i>," she answered with grave courtesy
and made to pass him, but he turned and walked by
her side. "Please, please!" he entreated. "If you
only knew how often I have looked for you! Don't
be unkind!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page151" id="page151" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
"Why you talk with me?" said Haru, turning.
"My Japanese girl�no all same your country."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You wild, pretty thing!" he said. "Why are
you so afraid of me? Foreigners don't eat butterflies."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No," she answered, without hesitation, "they
jus' break wings."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He laughed unevenly. Her quickness of retort
delighted him, and her beauty was stinging his blood.
He put out his hand and touched her sleeve, but she
drew away hurriedly:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"See!" she said. "My know those people to come
in gate. Talk�'bout my <i style="text-shadow: none;">papa-San</i>�please, so they
will to think he have know you, <i style="text-shadow: none;">n�</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil obeyed the hint, but Haru's cheeks, as she
saluted her friends, were flushing painfully. It was
her first subterfuge employed in a moment of embarrassment
with the realization that her home was
near and that she was violating the code of deportment
that from babyhood hedges about the young
Japanese girl with a complicated etiquette.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The women they had passed looked back curiously
at the foreigner walking with her. One, a girl of
Haru's own age, called smilingly after her:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Komban Mukojima de sho?</i>" Phil understood
the query. Was she going to Mukojima�to the
cherry festival�to-night! His eyes sparkled at the
tossed-back, "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hai!</i>" Well, he would be there, too!
He had appreciated the quick wit of her subterfuge.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page152" id="page152" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
The clever little baggage! She was not such a small,
brown saint, after all!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I think I did that rather well," he said, when they
had passed out of earshot. "They'll think your honorable
parent and I exchange New Year gifts at the
very least."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A little smile of irrepressible fun was lurking
under Haru's flush. "You have ask how is <i style="text-shadow: none;">papa-San</i>
rhu-ma-tis-um," she said. "In our street he
have some large fame, for because he so old and no
have got."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil laughed aloud. "Look here, little Haru,"
he said, "you and I are going to be great friends,
aren't we?" He looked down at the slim, nervous
arm, so soft and firm of flesh, so deliciously turned
and modeled. He knew a jade bracelet in Yokohama
that would mightily become it�he would
write to-night and have it sent up! "When can I
see you again, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They had turned into a narrow deserted lane,
bordered with bamboo fences, and opening, a little
way beyond, into the wider Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods.
She stopped as he spoke and shook her head.
"My no can tell," she answered. "No come more
far. My house very near now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He caught her hand�it was almost as small as a
child's, with its delicate wrist and slender fingers.
"Give me a kiss and I will let you go," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she shrank back indignantly against the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page153" id="page153" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
palings, her free hand flung up across her face, he
threw his arms about her and strained her to him.
She wrestled against him with little inarticulate
sobs, but he lifted her face and kissed her again and
again.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He released her, breathing hard, the veins in his
temples throbbing, his lips burning hot. He stood
a moment looking after her, as white-faced and
breathless, she fled down the bamboo lane.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There!" he muttered. "That's for you to remember
me by�till next time!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page154" id="page154" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXIX" id="chXIX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE BISHOP ASKS A QUESTION</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Bishop Randolph</span> lived in the quarter of
Tokyo called Ts'kiji�a section of "made-ground"
in the bay, composed, as the ancient
vestry jest had it, of the proverbial tomato-cans. It
was flat and low, and its inner canal in the old days
had formed the boundary of the extraterritorial
district given over by a reluctant government to the
residence of foreigners.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was a mile from the great, double-moated park
of the Imperial Palace, from the Diet and the Foreign
Office, whither, scarcely a generation ago, representatives
of European powers had galloped on
horse-back, with a mounted guard against swashbuckling
"two-sword men." The streets, however,
on which once an American Secretary of Legation,
so spurring, had been cut in two by a single stroke of
a thirsting <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i> sword, were peaceful enough in
this era of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Meiji</i>. The cathedral, the college, the low
brown hospital and the lines of red-brick mission
houses stood on grassy lawns behind green hedges
which gave a suggestion of a quiet English village.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page155" id="page155" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
A couple of the smaller Legations still clung to their
ancient sites and the quarter boasted, besides, a
score of ambitious European residences and a modern
hotel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the rectory the bishop sat at tiffin with the
archbishop of the Russian Cathedral, a man of seventy-eight,
gray-bearded and patriarchal�another
St. Francis Xavier. In this foreign field the pair
had been friends during more than a score of years.
Both were equally broad-minded, had long ago
thrown down the sectarian barriers too apt to prevail
in less restricted communities. To a large
extent they were confidants. The archbishop spoke
little English, and the bishop no Russian and but
"inebriate" French (as he termed it), so that their
talk was habitually in Japanese. When they had
finished eating both men bowed their heads in a
silent grace. The Russian, as he rose, made the
sign of the cross.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As they entered the library a wrinkled house-servant
sucked in his breath behind them.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Will the thrice-eminent guest deign to partake
of a little worthless tobacco?" he inquired, in the
ceremonious honorifics of the vernacular.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The thrice-eminent shook his head, and the bishop
answered: "Honorable thanks, Honda-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i>, our
guest augustly does not smoke."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the table they had been talking of the great
dream of both�the Christianization of modern
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page156" id="page156" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
Japan. The archbishop continued the conversation
now:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"As I was saying, the great stumbling-block is
the language. It is all right for you and me, who
have had twenty years at it, but our helpers haven't.
His code of courtesy forbids a Japanese to seem to
correct even when we are absurdly wrong. One of
my boys"�so the bishop affectionately referred to
his younger coadjutors�"was preaching the other
day on 'The Spiritual Attributes of Mankind.' He
meant to use the word <i style="text-shadow: none;">ningen</i>, man in the wide
sense. He preached, he thought, with a good deal of
success�the people seemed particularly grave and
attentive. Afterward he asked an old Japanese what
he thought of the subject. The man replied that he
had felt much instructed to find there were so many
things to be said about it. He added that he himself
generally ate them boiled. My young man had
used the word <i style="text-shadow: none;">ninjin</i>�carrots. 'The Spiritual Attributes
of Carrots!' And a whole sermon on it. Imagine
it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The archbishop threw back his head and laughed.
Then the conversation drifted again into the serious.
"Of course," said the bishop, "there is at bottom
the oriental inability to separate racial traits, to realize
that Christianity has made Christendom's glories,
not her shames. The Japanese are essentially
a spiritually-minded people. Some of the West's
most common vices they are strangely without. And
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page157" id="page157" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
their code of every-day morals�well, we can throw
very few stones at them there!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The archbishop nodded.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Few, indeed," he said. "No Japanese Don Juan
ever could exist. A Japanese woman would be scandalized
by a Greek statue. She would recoil at a
French nude. She would fly with astonishment and
shame from the sight of a western ballet. Our
whole system strikes the Oriental as not only monstrous
but disgustingly immoral. It seems to him,
for instance, sheer barbarity for a man to love his
wife even half as well as he does his own mother
and father. A curious case in point happened not
so long ago. A peasant had a mother who became
blind. He consulted the village necromancer, who
told him if his mother could eat a piece of human
heart she would get her sight back. The peasant
went home in tears and told his wife. She said, 'We
have only one boy. You can very easily get another
wife as good or better than me, but you might never
have another son. Therefore, you must kill me and
take my heart for your mother.' They embraced,
and he killed her with his sword. The child awoke
and screamed. Neighbors and the police came. In
the police court the peasant's tale moved the judges
to tears. They quite understood. They didn't condemn
the man to death. Really the one who ought
to have been killed was the necromancer."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And this," said the bishop musingly, "only a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page158" id="page158" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
few miles from where they were teaching integral
calculus and Herbert Spencer!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His visitor sat a while in thought. "By the way,"
he said presently, changing the subject, "I passed
your new Chapel the other day. It is very handsome.
Your niece, I think you told me, built it. May I
ask�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," said the host, "it is my dead sister's child,
Barbara�John Fairfax's daughter."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A look passed between them, and the bishop rose
and paced up and down, a habit when he was deeply
moved. "She came back to Japan with me," he continued.
"I am to take her to see the Chapel this
afternoon. Yesterday she told me that she intends
it to be dedicated to her father's memory."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a moment there was no reply. Then the other
said: "You have heard nothing of Fairfax all these
years?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not a word."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"She has never known?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bishop shook his head. "She believes he died
before her mother left Japan." He paused before
the window, his back to the other. "He was my
friend!" he said; "and I loved him. I gave my sister
to him, and she loved him, too!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I remember," said the archbishop slowly. "She
went back to America from Nagasaki. How
strange it was! She never told any one why she
left him?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page159" id="page159" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
"Never a word. She died before I went to
America again. She left me a letter which hinted
at something wholly unforgivable�almost Satanic,
it must have seemed to her."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And he?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Disappeared. He was thought to have gone to
China. Perhaps he is alive there yet. I have always
wondered. If so, how is he living�in what way?"
The bishop turned abruptly. "In view of what we
know, can I lend myself to the dedication of this
house of our Lord to a memory that may be infamous?
I ask you as a friend."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The older man was a long time silent.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"'His ways are past finding out,'" he said at
length. "I am conscious, sometimes, of a hidden
purpose in things. The daughter's memory of her
father is a beautiful thing. Let us not destroy it!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page160" id="page160" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXX" id="chXX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE TRESPASSER</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> bishop, and the Ambassador, when the
former's call was ended that afternoon, found
Barbara with Haru in the garden pagoda.
She sat on its wide ledge, Haru at her feet, in a
dainty <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of pale gray cotton-crepe with a
woven pattern of plum-blossoms. The oval Japanese
face showed no trace now of the passionate anger
with which she had fled from Phil's kisses. If it had
left a trace the trace was hidden under the racial
mask that habitually glosses the surface of oriental
feeling.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had fallen in love with Haru's piquant
personality�with her fragile loveliness, her quaint
phrasing, her utter desire to please. While Patricia
deepened her engaging freckles on the tennis court,
she had made the Japanese girl bring her <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>
and play. At first the music had seemed uncouth
and elfish�a queer, barbaric twanging, like an intoxicated
banjo with no bass string, tricked with unmelodious
chirpings, and woven with extraordinary
runs and unfamiliar intervals. But slowly, after the
first few moments, there had crept to her inner ear a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page161" id="page161" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
strange, errant rhythm. She had felt her feet
stealthily gliding, her arms bending, with those of
the score of listening children who at the first twittering
of the strings, had crept from stables and
servants' quarters like infant toads in a shower.
Afterward Haru, in her pretty broken English, had
told her stories�old legends that are embalmed in
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> dances, of the forty-seven <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ronin</i>, and of
the great <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shogun</i> who slept by the huge stone lanterns
in Uyeno Park.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When Barbara and her uncle started on their
walk�he was to show her the Chapel�the Ambassador
strolled with them as far as the main gate
of the compound. A string of carriages from the
Imperial stables�each with the golden chrysanthemum
on its lacquered panel�was just passing.
Their occupants, some of whom were Japanese and
some foreign, were in naval uniform, their breasts
covered with orders.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The officers of the foreign Squadron, no doubt,"
said the Ambassador, "being shown the sights of the
capital. Day after to-morrow the Minister of Marine
begins the official entertainment with a ball in
their honor. You will enjoy that, Barbara."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wish," said the bishop, "that the pessimists
who are so fond of talking of diplomatic 'strain'
could see a Japanese welcome. The stay of these
officers will be one long festivity. Yet to read a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page162" id="page162" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
Continental journal you would think every other
Japanese was carrying a club for use if they ventured
ashore."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador watched the cavalcade thoughtfully.
For weeks, the newspapers of European capitals
had talked of conflicting interests and unreconciled
differences between the two countries. He
knew that there was little in this, in fact, save the
journalistic necessity for "news" and a nervousness
that seems periodically to oppress highly strung
Chanceries as it does individuals. Beneath this surface
current, diplomacy had gone its even, temperate
way, undisturbed. But as a trained diplomatist he
knew that the most baseless rumor, if too long persisted
in, had grave danger, and he had welcomed
the coming of the Squadron, for the sake of the
effect on foreign public opinion, of the lavish and
open-hearted hospitality which Japan would offer it.
When the carriages had whirled past he bade the
others good-by and went back to his books.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Walking up the sloping "Hill-of-the-Spirit" to
the templed knoll behind it, Barbara felt in tune with
the afternoon. All along flaunting camphor-trees
and cryptomeria peered above the skirting walls
and the scent of wistaria was as heavy as that
of new-mown hay. The ground was white and
dusty and here and there briskly moving handcarts
were sprinkling water. Little girls, with their
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page163" id="page163" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
hair in pigtails tied with bright-colored yarn and
ribbon, and in brilliant figured <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of red and
purple, ran hither and thither in some game, and on
the gutter-edge a naked baby stared up at them
with grave, mistrustful eyes, his shaven head bobbing
in the sunshine. Half-way up the hill a group
of coolies were resting beside their carts. Their
faces had the look of lotos-eaters, languid and
serene. As they walked Barbara told of the adventure
of the evening before with the wolf-hound,
and of the Review of the morning, and the
bishop, shrewdly regarding her, thought he had
never seen her so beautiful.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What has happened�<i style="text-shadow: none;">who</i> has happened, Barbara?"
he asked, for he suddenly guessed he knew
what that look meant.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her eyes dropped and her rising color confirmed
his idea. "I don't know�do you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He took out his pocketbook and handed her a
clipping from a morning newspaper. It chronicled
the arrival of the yacht <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked at him out of eyes brimming with
laughter:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"'The time has come,' the Walrus said,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">'To talk of many things:</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">Of shoes�and ships�and sealing-wax�</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">Of cabbages��'"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But not Ware?" he finished. "All right. He'll
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page164" id="page164" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
speak for himself, no doubt. The paper says he's
at Nara; but then, he doesn't know you are here yet.
We pushed our sailing date forward, you remember."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm trying to curb my impatience," she said
blithely. "Meanwhile, I can't tell you what a good
time I'm having. I shall stay in Japan for ever: I
can feel it in my bones! I shall have a Japanese
house with a chaperon, two tailless cats and an <i style="text-shadow: none;">amah</i>,
and study the three systems of flower-arrangement
and the Tea-Ceremony."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They had reached the huge gate, with its little
booth in which a sentry now stood. "He wears the
uniform of the Imperial Guard," the bishop said.
"That is the residence of one of the daughters of
the Emperor."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned into the lane that opened opposite. It
was hedged with some unfamiliar thorny shrub with
woolly yellow blossoms, and a little way inside stood
an old temple gate with a stone <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i>. She stopped
with an exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he said, "there is the Chapel."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara was looking opposite the <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i>, where,
amid the flowering green, a slanting roof lifted,
holding a cross. It stood out, whitely cut against
the blue, a silent witness. Facing the dragon-swarming
gate, it made her think of pale martyrs in
gorgeous pagan countries, of Paul standing before
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page165" id="page165" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
the Temple of Diana in Ephesus, and lonely Christian
anchorites in profane lands of green and gold.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What Christians some of these Japanese make!"
the bishop said, as they finished their tour of the
building. "I know of a carpenter in Sendai who
became a convert. He used to visit the prison and
one day he took a woman there to see her husband,
a hardened and obdurate criminal. In the interview
the man stabbed his wife. The chief-of-police, on
account of the carpenter's reputation for justice and
pure-living, left the punishment of the man to him.
What do you think he did?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She could not guess.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He refused to punish him at all, on the simple
ground that Christ would not. As a result the convict
is now one of the best Christian teachers we
have in Sendai. The month before this happened,"
he continued, smiling reflectively, "a thief broke into
the rectory and stole my watch. I notified the police,
and they brought it back to me in a few days. But
where is my thief? You remember Jean Valjean
and the silver candle-sticks? Maybe the Sendai
carpenter was nearer right than I."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had paused in front of the black space
for the stained-glass window.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It will be here," the bishop said, answering her
thought. "It is to be put in place in time for the
dedication service to-morrow morning." He stepped
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page166" id="page166" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
to the door and peered into the interior. "You will
want to look about a bit, no doubt. I have a call to
make in the neighborhood�suppose I stop on my
way back for you."</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a few moments after his departure Barbara
stood listening to the dulled sound of the workmen's
tools. The roof of the temple opposite had a curving,
Tartar-like ridge, at either end of which was a
huge fish, its head pointed inward, its wide forked
tail twisted high in air. Under its scalloped eaves
she saw the flash of a swallow, and far above a
gaudy paper kite careened in the blue.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She crossed the lane and looked into the shady
inclosure, where the bronze lanterns and the tombstones
stood, as gray and lichened as the stone
beneath her feet. Before many of the graves stood
green bamboo vases holding bunches of fresh leaves.
An old woman was moving noiselessly about, watering
these with a long bamboo dipper and lighting
incense-sticks as she went. In one place a young
man knelt before an ancestral monument, softly
clapping his hands in prayer. The whole place
was drenched in a tone limpid and serene, the very
infusion of peace. Only in the black temple interior
she caught the dim glow of candles and somewhere
a muffled baton was tapping on hollow wood.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Min ... Min ... Min .. Min ..
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page167" id="page167" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;167]</span>
Min . Min . Min-Min-Min-Minminminminmin...."
At first slowly, then faster and faster,
till the notes merged and died away in a muttering
roll, to begin once more with the slowness of a leisurely
metronome.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The ornate front of the building on the right of
the yard attracted her and she went nearer. Beyond
the hedge she could see a portion of its garden.
Reflecting that this was a temple property and
hence, no doubt, open to the public, she unlatched
its bamboo gate and entered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Before her curved a line of flat stepping-stones set
in clean, gray gravel. On one side was a low camelia
hedge spotted with blossoms of deep crimson
and on the other a miniature thicket of fern and
striped ground-bamboo. Beyond this rose a mossy
hillock up whose green sides clambered an irregular
pathway, set with tall <i style="text-shadow: none;">shinto</i> lanterns and large
stones, like gigantic, many-colored quartz pebbles.
Here and there the flushed pink of cherry-trees made
the sky a tapestry of blue-rose, and in the hollows
grew a burnished, purple shrub that seemed to be
powdering the ground with the velvet petals of
pansies.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had seen many photographs of Japanese
gardens, but they had either lacked color or been
over-tinted. This lay chromatic, visualized, braided
with precious hues and steeped in the tender, unshamed
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page168" id="page168" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
glories of a tropic spring. For a moment
she shut her eyes to fix the picture for ever on her
brain.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She opened them again to a flood of sunlight on
the gilded carvings of the ancient structure. Its
<i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> had been noiselessly drawn open, and a man
stood there looking fixedly at her.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page169" id="page169" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXI" id="chXXI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE RESURRECTION OF THE DEAD</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">It was</span> the man she had seen that morning at
the entrance to the little park.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara realized instantly and uneasily that
she was an intruder. Yet she felt an intense interest,
mixed of what she had heard and of what she had
imagined. His <i style="text-shadow: none;">outr�</i> street-costume had now been
laid aside; he wore Japanese dress, with dark gray
<i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i> and white cleft sock. His iron-gray head was
bare. The expression of his face was conscious and
alert, with a sort of savage shyness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am afraid I am intruding," she said. "I ought
to have known the garden was private."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Private gardens may sometimes be seen, I suppose."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The words were ungracious, though the <i style="text-shadow: none;">timbre</i> of
the voice was musical and soft. "I beg your pardon,"
she said, and moved away.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He made a gesture, a quick timid movement of
one hand, and stepped down toward her. "No," he
said almost violently. "I don't want you to go.
Can't you see I mean you to stay?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara saw clearly now the variation in his eyes;
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page170" id="page170" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
the larger one was clouded, as though a film covered
the iris. It gave her a slight feeling of repugnance,
which she instantly regretted, for, as though rendered
conscious of it through a sensitiveness almost
telepathic, he turned slightly, and put a hand to his
brow to cover it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh," she said hastily, "I am glad. This is the
most beautiful garden I have ever seen."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked at her quickly and keenly with his one
bright eye. It held none of the swart, in-turned reflectiveness
of the Japanese; it was sharp and restless.
Its brilliance, under eyebrows that seemed
on the verge of a frown, was almost fierce. The
curved, gray mustache did not hide the strong, irregular,
white teeth.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You know Japanese gardens?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not yet," she answered. "Japan is new to me.
I needn't say how lovely I think this is�you must
grow tired hearing strangers rhapsodize over it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Strangers!" he laughed; the sound was not musical
like his spoken voice, but harsh and grating.
"I have one joy�no stranger ever dreams of coming
to see me!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I should have said 'your friends,'" said Barbara.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Friends would be more troublesome than my enemies,"
he said grimly, "who, at least, never ask me
where I don't want to go."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked at him wonderingly. She had never
met any one in the least like him. His features
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page171" id="page171" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
were refined and unquestionably aristocratic but his
whole expression was quiveringly sensitive, resentfully
shy. It was the expression, she thought, of
one whom a look might cut like a whiplash, a word
sting like a searing acid.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The only foreigners I know are those who write
me letters: malicious busybodies, people who want
subscriptions to all sorts of shams, or invite me to
join respectable, humbug societies, or write merely
to gratify a low curiosity. As for friends, I have
none."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Surely, I saw you with one this morning," she
said, with a smile.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah," he said, his look changing swiftly; "I don't
count Ishikichi. Children understand me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And me," she said. "I made friends with Ishikichi
this morning. He was catching crickets in the
garden. I am visiting the American Embassy," she
added.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The garden there has been a famous playground
for the child, no doubt," he returned. "His boon
companion lived just opposite the compound."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The little Toru, who was run over?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. Ishikichi has been inconsolable. To-day,
however, he has ceased to sorrow. The owner of
the carriage has sent six hundred <i style="text-shadow: none;">yen</i> to the father,
who is now able to pay his debts and enlarge his
business. The tablet on the Buddha-shelf that bears
the little boy's death-name will be henceforth the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page172" id="page172" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
dearest possession of the family. To Ishikichi he
is a glorious hero whose passing it would be a crime
to grieve." He broke off, with the odd, timid gesture
she had seen before. "But you came to see the
garden," he said. "If you like, I will show it to
you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Without waiting for her answer, he led the way,
moving quickly and agilely. The softness of his
tread in the cloth <i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi</i> seemed almost feminine. A
little farther on he turned abruptly:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"When you passed me in the carriage this morning
you must have thought me unmannerly," he
said. "I was, no doubt. My manners are only villainous
notions of my own."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not at all," she answered. "I only thought�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That perhaps I reminded you of some one you
had known."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned and walked on without reply. As they
proceeded, from behind the flowering bush came the
tintinnabulent tinkle and drip of running water. The
stepping-stones meandered on in graceful curves
and presently arrived at a little lake at whose edge
grew pale water-hyacinths and whose surface was
mottled with light green lotos-leaves, dotted here
and there with pink half-opened buds. Now and
then these stirred languidly at the flirt of a golden
fin, while over them, in flashes of flame-yellow,
darted hawking dragon-flies. Thickets of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page173" id="page173" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
maroon-tinted maple glowed in the sunlight and
clusters of yellow oranges hung on dwarf trees. On
the lake's margin bright-hued pebbles were strewn
between rounded stones whose edges were soft and
green with moss. Barbara longed to feel those
mossy boulders with her bare feet�to splash in that
limpid water like a happy child.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"This is the best view," he said simply.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Looking on the endless symphonies of green, it
came to her for the first time what fascination could
be wrought of mere brown stone and foliage. The
effect had a curious sense to her of the unsexual and
unhuman. Again, with the odd impression of telepathy
with which he had covered his myopic eye, he
seemed to answer her thought:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Japanese," he said, "sees Nature as neuter.
His very language possesses no gender. He does
not subconsciously think of a young girl when he
looks at a swaying palm, nor of the lines of a beautiful
body when he sees the undulations of the hills.
He notes much in nature, therefore, that western
art�which is passional�doesn't observe at all."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I see," she said. "We insist on looking through
a tinted film that makes everything iridescent?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"And deflects the lines of forms. The Japanese
art is less artificial. Now�turn to the left."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In one spot the trees and shrubbery had been cut
clean away, and through the vista she saw the distant
mountains, clear and pure as though carved of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page174" id="page174" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
tinted jade set in a plate of lapus lazuli. A faint
curdle of cloud frayed from their jagged tops, and
above it hung the dreamy snow-clad cone of Fuji,
palely emerald as the tint of glaciers under an
Alaskan sky. A single crow, a jet-black moving
spot, flapped its way across the azure expanse.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The one touch of blue," he said. "The color
ethical, the color pantheistic, the color of the idea of
the divine!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His personality, so touched with mystery, interested
Barbara intensely. The sense of strangeness
and unfamiliarity had quite vanished. She sat
down on one of the warm boulders. Thorn rested
one foot on the bent trunk of a dwarf tree and
leaned his elbow on his knee, his hand, in the gesture
that seemed habitual, covering his eye. In the wide
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> sleeve the forearm was bare and suggested
a peculiar physical cleanliness like that of a wild
animal.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How strange it is," she said, "that for centuries,
the western world believed this wonderful land inhabited
by a barbarous people�because it didn't
possess western civilization!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He made an exclamation. "Civilization! It is a
hateful word! It stands in the West for all that is
sordid and ugly. It has bred monstrous, thundering
piles built up to heaven, eternally smoking the
sky�places of architecture and mechanics gone
mad, where one lives by machinery and moves by
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page175" id="page175" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
steam, and is perpetually tormented by absurd conventions.
I have lived in its cities. I have walked
their selfish streets, shy and shabby and hungry!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Hungry!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes�and worse. I've not spoken of those experiences
for years. I don't know why I speak of
them now to you. Does it surprise you to hear that
I have known poverty?" For the first time he
turned fully facing her. His supple hand had left
his brow and moved in gestures at one time fierce
and graceful. "When I was sixteen I learned what
penury meant in London. Once I was driven to take
refuge in a workhouse in some evil quarter of the
Thames. My memory of it is a mixture of dreadful
sights and sounds�of windows thrown violently
open or shattered to pieces�of shrieks of murder�of
heavy plunges in the river."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara shuddered in the warm sunlight. Over
the edge of the garden was a misty space where
foliage and roofs sank out of sight, to rise again in
long undulations of green trees and gray tiling, like
a painted ocean. Far away lifted the leafy plateau
of Aoyama, with its blur of terra-cotta barracks. At
an immense distance a great temple roof jutted, and
still farther away the spread-out, populous city
curved up, like the rim of a basin, to a hazy horizon.
Yet on this background of pleasantness and peace
those other scenes of horror�such was the vehemence
of his tone, the savage directness in his
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page176" id="page176" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
phrases�seemed to start up, blank and wretched
apparitions, before her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"At nineteen," he went on. "I found myself in
New York, delicate, diffident, satanically proud, and
without a friend�one of the billion ants crawling in
the skeleton of the mastodon. I was threadbare and
meals were scant and uncertain�a little, penniless,
half-blind, eccentric wanderer! I lived in a carpenter-shop
and slept on the shavings. One week I sold
coral for a Neapolitan peddler. Oh, I learned my
civilization well! The very memory now of walking
down those roaring ca�ons of streets�all cut granite
and iron fury, and hideous houses two hundred
feet high�moos at me in the night! It is frightful,
nightmarish, devilish! And when one can be here
under a violet sky, in sight of blue peaks and an
eternally lilac, luke-warm sea!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His hand swept across the hewn vista�to the
wild, bold background of indigo hills, with its slender
phantom above them, swimming in the half-tropical
blue. "It is better," he said, "to live in
Japan in sack-cloth and ashes, than to own the half
of any other country. I am as old as the three-legged
crow that inhabits the sun. I can't read the comic
papers or a French novel. I shouldn't go to the Paris
opera if it were next door. I shouldn't like to visit
the most beautiful lady and be received in evening
dress. I shall pass my life in sandals and a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>,
and when it's over I shall be under the big trees in
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page177" id="page177" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
the old Buddhist cemetery there, beside the nunnery,
among the fireflies and grasshoppers, with six laths
above me, inscribed with prayers in an unknown
tongue and a queerly carved monument typifying the
five elements into which we melt away."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He shook his broad shoulders. Again his hand
went to his brow and he half turned away.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But now even Japan must adopt western civilization,"
he said bitterly. It is 'putting a lily in
the mouth of hell!' Carpets, pianos, windows, brass-bands�to
make Goths out of Greeks! Who would
want them changed? Who would not love them as
they are, better than the children of boasted western
civilizations�industrious, pleasing, facing death
with a smile, not because they are such fatalists as
the Arabs, for instance, but because they have no
fear of the hereafter. The old courtesy, the old
faith, the old kindliness�will they weather it? Or
vanish like snow in sun? The poetry, the legend, the
lovely and touching observances are going fast.
Modernism gives them foreign fireworks now, and
forbids the ghost-boats of the Bon! I wish I could
fly out of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Meiji</i> for ever, back against the stream of
time, into <i style="text-shadow: none;">tempo</i> fourteen hundred years ago!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Bon?" she said. "What is that?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I forgot," he said, "that Japan is all new to you,"
and told her of the Japanese All-Souls Day�the
Feast of Lanterns, when the spirits of the dead return,
to be fed with tea in tiny cups and with the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page178" id="page178" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
odor of incense; how, when the dusk falls, on canal
and river the little straw boats are launched with
written messages and lighted paper lanterns, to
bear back the blessed ghosts.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Returning, Barbara led the way. Once she stooped
over a single, strange blossom on a long stalk, whose
golden center shone cloudily through silky filaments
like the leaves of immortelles. "What is that?" she
asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is a wild flower I found on one of my inland
rambles," he said. "Perhaps it has no name. I call
it <i style="text-shadow: none;">Yum�-no-hana</i>�the 'Flower-of-Dream.' It will
open almost any day now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Have you quite forgiven me for breaking in?"
she asked, as they walked along the stepping-stones.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For the first time she surprised him in a smile. It
lit his face with a sudden irradiation. "Will you do
it again?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"May I�some time?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Then you are not afraid? Remember I am a
renegade, a follower of Buddha, and a most atrocious
and damnable <i style="text-shadow: none;">taboo</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Afraid!" For a moment they looked at each
other, and she saw a little quiver touch his lips. "I
shall come again to-morrow�to see the flower."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Just one thing," he said. "I am a solitary. If
you would not mention�to any one�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I understand," she answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He walked by her side to the bamboo gate. "I
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page179" id="page179" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
am glad," she said, "that I remind you of some one
you liked."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Perhaps it was some one I knew in a dream," he
answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," she said. "Perhaps it was."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she spoke she saw him start. She looked up.
Across the temple yard, through the entrance <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i>,
she saw the bishop coming up the lane. He was
walking absorbed in thought, his eyes on the ground,
his hands clasped behind him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Good-by," she said, and stepped through the
gate.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But Thorn did not answer. At sight of the approaching
figure he had drawn back abruptly. Now
he turned sharply away into a path which led toward
the temple. She saw him once glance swiftly back
over his shoulder before he disappeared behind the
hedges.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The man with whom Barbara had been talking
went slowly up the temple steps. His face was haggard
and drawn. There he paused and looked back
across the yard.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Credo in resurrectionem mortuorum</i>," he muttered�"Yes,
I believe in the resurrection of the
dead!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he stood there the head priest pushed open the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>. He bowed to the other on the threshold and
came out.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page180" id="page180" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
"To-day my abashed thought has dwelt on your
exalted work," he said. "Is our new image of Kwan-on
peerlessly all but done, perhaps?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn shook his head. "It moves with exalted
slowness. To-day I contemptibly have not worked."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The priest looked at him curiously, through his
gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You are honorably unwell," he said. "It is better
to lie down in the heat of the day. Presently I
will say an insignificant prayer to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Hotok�-Sama</i>�the
Shining Ones�for your illustrious recovery."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am not ill," was the answer. "Be not augustly
concerned."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned away slowly and crossed the little
bridge to his own abode.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page181" id="page181" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXII" id="chXXII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE DANCE OF THE CAPITAL</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> Ginza�the "Street-of-the-Silversmiths"�is
the Broadway, the Piccadilly, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Boulevard
des Italiens</i> of modern Tokyo. Here
old and new war daily in a combat in which the new
is daily victor. Modern shop-fronts of stone and
brick stand cheek by jowl with graceful, flimsy
frame structures that are pure Japanese. Trolley-cars,
built in the United States, fill the street with
clangor and its pavements (for it has them) roar
with trade.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In its flowing current one may see many types:
Americans from the near-by Imperial Hotel, bristling
with enthusiasm; earnest tourists with Murrays
tucked in their armpits, doggedly "doing"
the country; members of foreign Legations whirling
in victorias; Chinamen, queued and decorously clad
in flowered silk brocade; an occasional Korean with
queerly shaped hat of woven horse-hair; over-dandified
<i style="text-shadow: none;">O-shar�-Sama</i>�"high-collar" men, as the Tokyo
phrase goes�in tweeds and yellow puttees; comfortable
merchants and men of affairs in dull-colored
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> and clogs; blue-clad workmen with the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page182" id="page182" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
marks of their trades stamped in great red or white
characters on their backs; sallow, bare-footed students
with caps of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Waseda</i> or the Imperial University;
stolid and placid-faced Buddhist priests in
<i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, en route to some temple funeral; soldiers in
khaki with red- and yellow-striped trousers; coolies
dragging carts; country people on excursions from
thatched inland villages, clothed in common cloth
and viewing the capital for the first time with indrawn
breath and chattering exclamations; rich
noblemen, beggars, idlers, guides�all are tributary
to this river.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When evening falls women and children predominate:
bent old women with brightly blackened teeth;
patient-faced mothers with babies on their backs
toddling on clacking wooden <i style="text-shadow: none;">g�ta</i>; white-faced vermilion-lipped
<i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> glimpsing by in <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> to
some tea-house entertainment; coolie women dressed
like men, trudging in the roadway; girl-students
peering into jewelers' windows; children clad like
gaudy moths and butterflies, clattering hand in
hand, or pursuing one another with shrill cries.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Before the sun has well set lanterns begin to
twinkle and glow above doorways�yellow electric
bulbs in clusters, white acetylene globes, smoky oil
lamps, and great red and white paper-lanterns lit by
candles. As the violet of the dusk deepens to purple,
these multiply till the vista is ablaze. Lines
of colored lights in pink and lemon break out like
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page183" id="page183" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
air-flowers along upper stories of tea-houses, from
whose interiors come the strumming of <i style="text-shadow: none;">biwa</i> and
the twang of <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>. On frail balconies, pricked
out with yellow lanterns, dwarf pines or jars of
growing azalea hang their masses of soft green or
pink down over the passers-by. From open <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>
women lean, their <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> parted, their rounded
breasts bared to the cool night.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the curb peripatetic dealers squat in little stalls
formed of movable screens with their wares spread
before them; curio-merchants with a <i style="text-shadow: none;">m�lange</i> of
brass, crystal and bronze; dealers in <i style="text-shadow: none;">suzumushi</i>�musical
insects in the tiniest cages of plaited straw;
sellers of Buddhist texts and worm-eaten, painted
scrolls; of ink-horns, shoe-sticks, eye-glasses and
children's toys. At intervals grills of savory <i style="text-shadow: none;">waka-fuji</i>
(salted fry-cakes) sizzle over charcoal braziers
which throw a red glow on an intent row of children's
faces. Here and there a shop-front emits the
blatant bark of a foreign phonograph. On the corners
men with arms full of vernacular evening newspapers
call the names of the sheets in musical
cadences, with a quaint, upward inflection. The air is
filled with a heavy, rich odor, suggesting the pomade
of women's head-dresses, <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i>, and sandalwood. In
the roadway every vehicle contributes its bobbing
lantern, till the traffic seems a celestial Saturnalia,
staggering with drunken stars.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">So it looked to Barbara as her two <i style="text-shadow: none;">goriki</i>�"strong-pull
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page184" id="page184" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
men"�whirled her rubber-tired <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>
across the interminable city in her first bewildering
view of Tokyo by night. Daunt, for her benefit,
had arranged a trip to the Cherry-Viewing-Festival
on the Sumida River, and a Japanese dinner at the
Ogets'�the Cherry-Moon Tea-House�in the famous
district of Asak'sa, where the great temple of
Kwan-on the Merciful shines with its ever-burning
candles. They had started from the Embassy: Baroness
Stroloff, the wife of the Bulgarian Minister
and Patricia's especial favorite, the twin sisters of the
Danish Secretary, the Swiss Minister's daughter
and two young army officers studying the language�all
of whom Barbara had met at the Review�and
the long procession (since police regulations in Tokyo
forbid <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> to travel abreast) trailed "goose-fashion,"
threading in and out, a writhing, yellow-linked
chain.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt had traced their route with Barbara on a
map of the city, and had translated for her the
names of the streets through which they were now
passing. By the Street-of-Big-Horses they skirted
the District-of-Honorable-Tea-Water, threaded the
Lane-where-Good-Luck-Dwells, and so, by Middle-Monkey-Music-Street,
they came to the Sumida, a
broader, slothful Thames, gleaming with ten thousand
lanterns on <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>, houseboats and barges.
The bridge of Ah-My-Wife brought them to the
farther side. At the entrance of a long avenue of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page185" id="page185" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
blooming cherry-trees a policeman halted them.
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Rick'sha</i> were not permitted beyond this point and
the sweating human horses were abandoned.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The road ran high along the river on a green embankment
like a wide wall, between double rows of
cherry-trees, whose branches interlocked overhead.
It was densely crowded with people, each one of
whom seemed to be carrying a colored paper-lantern
or a cherry-branch drooped over the shoulder. In
the hues of the loose, warm-weather <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
bloomed all the flowers of all the springs�golds
and mauves and scarlets and magentas�and everywhere
in the lantern-light fluttered radiant-winged
children, like vivid little birds in a tropical forest.
From tiny one-storied tea-houses along the way,
with elevated mats covered with red flannel blankets,
<i style="text-shadow: none;">biwa</i> and <i style="text-shadow: none;">koto</i> and <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> gurgled and fluted
and tinkled. On the right the embankment descended
steeply, giving a view of sunken roadways
and tiled roofs; on the left lay the long reaches of
the dreamy river murmuring with oars and voices
and vibrating like a vast flood of gold and vermilion
fireflies.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had never imagined such a welter of
movement and color. The soft flute-like voices,
the slow shuffling of sandals on the dry earth, the
pensive smiling faces, the pink flowers on every
hand, made this different from any holiday
crowd she had ever seen. It suggested a carnival
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page186" id="page186" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span>
of Venice orientalized, painted over and set
blazing with Japanese necromancy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Here and there jugglers and top-spinners displayed
their skill to staring spectators. A cluster of
shaven-headed babies swarmed silently about a
sweetmeat seller, and beside his push-cart a man
clad like a gray-feathered hawk whistled discordantly
on a bamboo reed and gyrated with a vacant
grin on his pock-marked face. Where the crowd
was less close men tricked out in girls' attire, with
whitened, clown-like faces, turned somersaults, and
through the thickest of the press a dejected, blaze-faced
ox, whose nose and forehead were painted
with spots of scarlet, slowly drew a two-storied
scaffold on which was perched the god of spring�a
plaster figure wreathed with flowers. The animal's
ears were tickled by long tassels of bright green and
red, and his look was one of patient boredom. The
man who led him wore a short jerkin, and his bare
legs, from thigh to knee, were tattooed in big, blue,
graceful leaves.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The greatest numbers surged about a large tent,
outside of which waddled here and there mountains
of men, their faces round as full moons, naked save
for gaily colored aprons. The fat hung on their
breasts in great creased folds like an overfed baby's,
and in the lantern-light their flesh looked an unhealthy,
mottled pink. Each wore his hair wound
in a short queue, bent forward and tied in a stiff
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page187" id="page187" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
loop on the crown. As one of the vast hulks lumbered
by, cooling his moon-face with a tiny fan,
Daunt pointed him out to Barbara.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is the famous Hitachiyama," he told her,
"the champion wrestler of Japan."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How big he is!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It runs in families," he said. "They diet and
train, too, from babyhood. He weighs three hundred
and forty-seven pounds."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A roar came from the lighted canvas and a man
emerged and wrote something on a sign-board like
a tally-sheet. Daunt stopped and perused it. "You
may be interested, ladies and gentlemen," he said,
"to learn that Mr. Terrible-Horse has knocked out
Mr. Small-Willow-Tree, but that Mr. Tiger-Elephant
has been allowed a foul over Mr. Frozen-Stork.
I wish we could see a bout, but we must
hurry or we'll miss the <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> dancing."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They came presently where the roadway overlooked
a sunken temple yard encircled by moats of
oozy slime dotted with pink and white lotos buds.
The inclosure was set with giant cryptomeria centuries
old, and was crowded with people. Stone steps
led down between twisted pine-trees and <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> lanterns,
to a gate on whose either side was a great
stone cow, rampant, like the figures in coats-of-arms.
There was a droll contrast between the posture
and the placid bovine countenances. In the
center of the inclosure rose a wide platform with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page188" id="page188" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
a tasseled curtain like the stage of a theater. Opposite
was a pavilion in which sat rows of women in
dark-colored dress, moveless as images and holding
musical instruments. The whole flagged space between
jostled with the iridescent, lantern-carrying
throng. A priest led the party to seats at one side
on mats reserved for foreign visitors.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Look, Barbara," said Patricia. "There goes our
friend the expert�across there. He looks bigger
and pastier than ever."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin was dressed in white flannel which accentuated
his enormous size. A younger man was
with him, smoking a cigarette, and in their wake
followed a Japanese servant.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The rest of the party had turned and were looking
in that direction. "Why," said Baroness Stroloff,
"that's Doctor Bersonin."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">One of the young army men looked at her curiously.
"Do you know him?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why, of course. One meets him everywhere.
I saw him at a dinner last week. Have you met
him?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, yes, we're supposed to know everybody,"
he said carelessly. His tone, however, held something
which made her say:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Most men don't like him, I find. I wonder
why."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why don't people like lizards?" said Patsy.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page189" id="page189" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
"Because they're cold and clammy and wicked-looking."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"They like them enough to eat them in Senagambia,"
said the young officer smiling. "Bersonin is a
great man, no doubt, but there's something about
him�I met a man once who had run across him in
South America and�he was prejudiced. Who's
the young fellow with him, Daunt?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"His name is Ware�Philip Ware," was the answer.
"I knew him at college."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara felt the blood staining her cheeks. So
that was "Phil," the brother of whom Austen Ware
had told her! The name called up thoughts that
had obtruded themselves in the moment she saw the
white yacht lying at anchor, and which since then
she had wilfully thrust from her mind. Her gaze
studied the handsome, youthful form, noting the
bold, restless glance, the dissipated lines of the
comely face, with a sudden distaste. A twang from
the orchestra recalled her, as the curtain was looped
back for the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Miyako Odori</i>, the "Dance of the Capital."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was Barbara's introduction to a native orchestra
and at first its strummings and squealings, its
lack of modes and of harmony, its odd barbaric
phrasing, infected her with a mad desire to laugh.
But gradually there came to her the hint of under-rhythm�as
when she had listened to Haru's <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>
in the garden�and with it an overpowering
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page190" id="page190" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
sense of suggestion. It was the remote cry of occult
passions, a twittering of ghostly shadows, the wailing
of an oriental Sphynx whom Time had abandoned
to the eternal desert. It had in it melancholy
and the enigma of the ages. It wiped away the
ugly modern European buildings, the western costumes,
the gloze of borrowed method, and left Barbara
looking into the naked heart of the East, old,
intent, and full of mystical meaning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The ivory plectrons chirruped, the flutes squeaked
and wailed, the little hour-glass drums thudded, and
down the stage swept sixty <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>, in blue, cherry-painted
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>. A sly, thin thread of scarlet peeped
from their woven sleeves. Their small <i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi'd</i> feet,
cleft like the foot of a faun, moved in slow, hovering
steps. When they wheeled, swaying like
young bamboo, they stamped softly, and the white
foot, raised from the boards, under the puffed <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
edge writhed and bent from the ankle like a
pliant hand. Their faces, heavily powdered, and
held without expression, looked like white, waxen
masks in which lived sparkling black eyes. In the
slow, languorous movement their <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i> of gold and
fans of silver caught the cherry-shaded lights and
tossed them back in gleams of mother-of-pearl.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara fell to watching the Japanese spectators.
All around her they stood and sat at ease, drinking
in the play of color and motion of which they never
tire. The dance had no passion, no sensuality,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page191" id="page191" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
none of the savagery and abandon of the dances of
Southern Asia, with whose reproductions the western
stage is familiar. Beside a ballet of the West, it
would have seemed almost ascetic. She knew that
it was symbolic�that every posture was a sentence
of a story they knew, as old and as sacred, perhaps,
as the birth of the gods.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The parted curtain swung together and Daunt
seated himself at Barbara's side. "Do you like it,
ever so little?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ever so <i style="text-shadow: none;">much</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wonder if you are going to like me, too," he
said, so softly that no one else heard.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She felt her color coming as she answered:
"Why, of course. How could I help it, when you
plan things like this for me?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I have at last found my <i style="text-shadow: none;">m�tier</i>; give me more
things to do."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Very well. When will you take me to see your
Japanese house?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a second Daunt hesitated. The little native
house in the Street-of-the-Misty-Valley was a sentimental
place to him. There he had worked out
the models of his first Glider; there he had talked
with his Princess of Dreams, his "Lady of the
Many-Colored Fires." The glimpse of Phil had
reminded him that it now had a tenant. When he
showed it to Barbara, it should not be with Phil in
possession.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page192" id="page192" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
She noted the hesitation, and, somewhat puzzled,
and wondering if to oriental ethics the suggestion
was a <i style="text-shadow: none;">gaucherie</i>, waved the matter lightly aside.
"You are just going to say 'one of these days.'
Please don't. When I was little, that always meant
never. I withdraw the motion�but what is this
coming?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A boy was ascending the platform. He bowed and
laid a box of thin unpainted wood at Daunt's feet.
It contained a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kakemono</i>, or wall-painting, rolled
and tied with a red-and-white cord of twisted rice-paper.
Daunt read the accompanying card.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"'Miss Happy-for-a-Thousand-Years,'" he said,
"'presents her compliments to the illustrious strangers.'
She is the star. The gift is a pretty custom,
isn't it, even if it is advertisement. Here comes
the lady herself to present her thanks for our distinguished
patronage."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She bowed low before them, smiling, her small
piquant face powdered white as mistletoe-berries
above her carmine-painted lips. Daunt unrolled the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kakemono</i>, revealing a delicately-painted cluster of
butterflies. He chatted with her in the vernacular,
and she replied with much drawing-in of breath and
flute-like laughter.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"She says," he translated, "that this is a picture
of her honorable ancestors." A little smile, a genuflection,
a breath of perfume and the powdered face
and gorgeous <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> were gone. The orchestra
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page193" id="page193" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
chirruped, the curtain parted and another figure began.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Miss Happy-for-a-Thousand-Years! As the party
walked back to the waiting <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, Barbara wondered
what lay beneath that smiling surface. She
had heard of the strenuous training that at five years
began to teach the gauzy, fragile, child-butterfly to
paint its wings, to flirt and sing and dance its dazzling
moth-flame way. For the <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> nothing was
too gorgeous, too transcendent. Her lovers might
be statesmen and princes. But in return she must
be always gay, always laughing, always young�all
things to all men�to the end of the butterfly chapter!
Butterfly hair, butterfly gown�and butterfly
heart?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara wondered.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page194" id="page194" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXIII" id="chXXIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE DEVIL PIPES TO HIS OWN</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Doctor</span> Bersonin, huge and white-flanneled,
with Phil by his side, strolled away through
the swarming crowd.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Not a word, not a glance of the younger man
that evening, had escaped him�he had been studying
him with all the minute attention of that great,
overweening brain that, from an origin of which he
never spoke, had made him one of the foremost experimenters
in Europe. The swift gleam in Phil's
eye as he watched the <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>, the eager drinking in
of the girlish daintiness, the colors and perfumes to
which he stretched himself like a cat�the watchful,
impassive eyes took note of everything. All Bersonin's
talk had held an evil lure. It had touched
on the extravagant and sensual vagaries of luxury,
the sybaritic pleasures of the social <i style="text-shadow: none;">gourmet</i>,
subjects appealing to the imagination of the youth
whom he was examining like a slide under the microscope.
They had stopped once at a <i style="text-shadow: none;">chaya</i> for
tea, but Phil had called for the hot native <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i>, and
as its musty, sherry-like fumes crept into his blood he
talked with increasing recklessness. Beneath their
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page195" id="page195" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
veiled contemptuousness, Bersonin's feline eyes began
to harbor a stealthy satisfaction. He had
guessed why Phil had suggested coming to Mukojima.
The latter's restlessness, his anxious surveillance
of the passers-by, might have enlightened
a less observant spectator.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's new passion had, in fact, a strong hold
on him. That long-ago picture of Haru, barefooted
in the surf, frequent recollection had stamped
on his brain and the sight of her fresh beauty to-day
had fanned the coal to a flame. Those stolen
kisses in the bamboo lane had roused a lurking devil
that counted nothing but his own desires. For this
hour, while the <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i> ran in his pulses, the flame
overshadowed even Bersonin.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, my boy," said the latter at length quizzically,
"when you find her, just give me the hint
and I'll go."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil flushed, then laughed shortly. "So you are
a mind-reader, too?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's written all over you," said Bersonin. "Why
didn't you tell me? We could have postponed our
dinner and left you free for the chase. It <i style="text-shadow: none;">is</i> a chase,
eh?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," said Phil. "I�I haven't had much luck
with her yet. I just happened to know she was to
be here to-night. She's a pretty little devil," he
added, "the prettiest I've seen in Japan."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Japanese type is the rage in Paris now,"
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page196" id="page196" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
said the other. "Take her there, dress her in jewels,
and drive her through the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Bois</i> some afternoon and
you'll be the most talked-of man in France next
morning."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The red deepened in Phil's cheek. The prospect
drew him. He looked at Bersonin. Paris and
jewels!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He drank more <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i> at the next tea-house. It
had begun to show in a shaking of the hand, a
louder voice. Suddenly Phil sprang to his feet.
"There she is!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin looked. "Lovely!" he said, "I congratulate
you. I'll walk back to the motor-car�the
sights amuse me. You can come along when
you please. Dinner will wait. And, anyway, what's
dinner to a pretty woman?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil plunged into the crowd and the expert spoke
quickly to the servant, who was staring after him.
"Better keep him in sight," he said. "You can come
when he does."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin was sauntering on, when a turmoil behind
him made him turn. A woman's cry and an
angry oath in English rang out, startlingly clear
above the low murmur of the multitude. He caught a
glimpse of a Japanese form leaping like a tiger�of
Phil lying in the dust of the road�of a girl vanishing
swiftly into the shadows.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As the expert hurried forward, Phil stumbled to
his feet. Lights were dancing before his eyes and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page197" id="page197" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
his neck felt as if he had been garroted. With his
first breath he turned on Ishida, incoherent with
rage and curses. The big man caught his arm.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The honorable sir make mistake," said the Japanese
smoothly. "Man have done that who have
ranned away."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He lies!" said Phil fiercely. "There was no one
else near me but the girl. He did it himself! He
tried to <i style="text-shadow: none;">ju-jits'</i> me!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The fingers of the Japanese were clenched, but
his face was impassive as he added: "I think he
have been snik-thief."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That's no doubt the way it was, Phil," said Bersonin.
"Why on earth would Ishida touch you?
That's an old thieves' trick. The fellow tried to get
your watch, I suppose. But we must move on. The
police will be here presently, and we don't want our
names in the papers."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They went rapidly through the close ranks that
had been watching with the decorous, inquisitive
silence so typically oriental.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I suppose you're right," said Phil sulkily. "I�I
beg your pardon, Ishida."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Japanese bowed gravely.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Only a mistake," he said, "which honorable sir
make."</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page198" id="page198" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXIV" id="chXXIV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">A MAN NAMED WARE</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> three-storied front of the Cherry-Moon
Tea-House, when Daunt's party arrived, was
glowing with tiers of large round lanterns
of oiled-paper bearing a conventionalized moon and
cherry-blossoms. At the door sat rows of little velvet-lined
sandals. Here shoes were discarded, and
servants drew on the guests' feet loose slippers of
cotton cloth, soft and yielding. One other guest was
awaiting the party at the entrance. This was Captain
Viscount Sakai, of the General Staff, spruce, fine-featured
and in immaculate European evening dress.
He had a clear, olive complexion, and, save for the
narrow, Japanese eye, might have been a Spaniard.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The small second-story <i style="text-shadow: none;">shokudo</i> in which they
dined was floored in soft <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i> edged with black
and laid in close-fitting geometrical pattern. Save
for a plain alcove at one end, holding a dwarf pine
and a single <i style="text-shadow: none;">nanten</i> branch with clusters of bright
red berries, it was empty. There was no drapery.
The walls were sliding screens of gold-leaf on which
were finely drawn etchings of pine-trees covered
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page199" id="page199" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
with snow, the effect suggested rather than finished.
It was brilliant with electric light.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Tiny square tables of black lacquer were disposed
along three sides of the room, one for each guest.
They were but four inches high and on the floor behind
each lay a thin, flat <i style="text-shadow: none;">zabuton</i> or cushion of brocade.
The bowing <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> in wonderful rainbow
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> who awaited them might have stepped from
the temple stage at Mukojima. These pointed to the
tables with inviting smiles:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Plee shee down!" they said in unison.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I never <i style="text-shadow: none;">could</i> 'shee down' gracefully when any
one is looking!" complained Patricia, as she tucked
her small feet under her on the kneeling-cushion.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Banzai!</i>" commented Voynich, setting his monocle.
"You have practised before a mirror!" He
collapsed beside her with a groan. "I shall be reincarnated
an accordion!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Count," said Patricia plaintively, "no bouquets,
please. I know when you are stringing me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked blank and the Japanese officer hastily
produced a lavender note-book and a gold pencil.
"That is a new one," he said. "I must�what is it?�ah
yes! I must <i style="text-shadow: none;">nail</i> it. Excuse me. I write it
in my swear-album."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The Viscount is learning American slang," Patricia
informed Barbara. "One of these days you
must tell him some of the very latest."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked across with gravely twinkling eyes. "I
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page200" id="page200" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;200]</span>
shall be�ah�tickle to die!" he said. "It is my
specialty. Nex' year I become Professor in Slang
Literature at the Imperial University."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The meal began merrily. Barbara sat on Daunt's
left, with one of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">attach�s</i> next her. Baroness
Stroloff was on Daunt's other hand. Barbara remembered
it afterward as a meal of elfish daintiness�of
warm, pungent, wine-like liquor in blue porcelain
bottles, of food of strange look and cloying
taste, highly colored and seasoned, in a hundred
tiny red and black lacquer dishes that carried her
back to her doll-days, with covers patterned in gold,
served by prostrating <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> whose <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> were
woven with violet Fujis, winged dragons and marvelous
exotic blossoms.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt pointed to a dish which had just been set
before her. "You must try the <i style="text-shadow: none;">hasu-no-renkon</i>," he
said. "That's cooked lotos-root. It's nearly as
good as it looks."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How do you ever remember the names!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, it's quite easy to talk Japanese," he replied
recklessly. "There are only fifty syllables in the
language, and any way you string them together it
means something or other. It doesn't matter
whether it's the right thing or not, if you just bow
and smile. There are seventeen ways of drawing
in your breath which are a lot more important than
what you say!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page201" id="page201" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
"What disgraceful nonsense! What is that pink
thing?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Raw bonito. The refuge of dyspeptics. Voynich,
over there, eats nothing else at home, they say.
The variegated compound is <i style="text-shadow: none;">kuchitori</i>. It's made of
sugared chestnuts, leeks and pickled fish. May I
compliment you on the way you handle your chopsticks?
At my first Japanese dinner I bit one in
two. Isn't Baroness Stroloff stunning, by the way!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The latter was deep in discussion with Patricia,
moving her hands in quick, vivacious gestures which
clusters of opals made into flashes of blue fire.
"But you must send to Hakodate for your furs," she
was saying. "I will give you the address of my man
there. You should get them now, not wait till fall,
when the tourists have bought all the best."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm dying for an ermine stole."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, my <i style="text-shadow: none;">dear</i>, not ermine! Get sables. One can
be so insulting in sables!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara laughed with the rest. "What a nice lot
you are," she said, "all knowing each other, all
friendly. I thought diplomatists were always poring
over international law books and drawing up
musty treaties."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's not all cakes and ale," he asserted. "I
worked till three this morning on a cipher telegram."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"After the melodrama?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah, it was opera!" he protested. "It has left
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page202" id="page202" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
me memories of only flowers, and scents and music!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You made most of the music, if I remember
rightly."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How unkind! I could no more help it than
fly."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"On your Glider?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He laughed again. "Don't forget what is to happen
one day with that same machine."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What is that?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am to swoop down and carry you off. It was
your own suggestion, you know."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But it was to be at the Imperial Review. That
doesn't happen again for a year."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I won't wait that long!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned her head; her eyes sparkled in the
caught light. Her fingers were fluttering a square
of red paper that had been rolled about her chopsticks.
On it was a line of tiny characters. "What
is that writing?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is a love-poem," he answered. "You know
a Japanese poem has only thirty-one syllables. You
find them everywhere and on everything, from a
screen to a fire-shovel. I've seen them printed on
tooth-picks. Your huckster composes them as he
brings the fish from market, and your <i style="text-shadow: none;">amah</i> writes
them at night by a firefly lantern."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Can you read it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He translated: "<i style="text-shadow: none;">I thought my love's long hair</i>
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page203" id="page203" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
<i style="text-shadow: none;">drooped down from the gate of the sky. But it was
only the shadow of evening.</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How delicately pretty!" she exclaimed. "It's
written in <i style="text-shadow: none;">kana</i>, the sound-alphabet, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. How much you have learned already!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Haru has begun teaching me. Let me show
you my proficiency." She took his pencil and wrote:</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;">&#12489;&#12531;&#12488;</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There! who would guess that was Japanese for
'Daunt.' And what an impression you must have
made on Haru for her to select your name as my
first lesson!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Across the soft <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoo-shoo</i> of spotless, <i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi</i>-clad
feet, the flitting of bright-hued <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, the gay
badinage that flew about the low tables, Daunt felt
her beauty thrill him from head to foot like a garment
of mist and fire. As she dropped her hand to
the cushion it had touched his, and for an instant
their pulses had seemed to throb into one. The
tiny, lacquered cup she took up trembled in her
fingers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She started when the young army officer nearest
her said: "Speaking of sailing, give me a steam-yacht
like the one that berthed yesterday at Yokohama.
She belongs to a man named Ware�Austen
Ware�a New Yorker, I understand. Perhaps you
know him, Miss Fairfax."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page204" id="page204" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
"I have met him," she answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The young army officer looked up quickly�he
was an enthusiastic yachtsman. "A beautiful vessel!"
he said. "I noticed her to-day, but she was
too far away to make out her name."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>," said Voynich.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why�" exclaimed Patricia, "that's�" She
bit her tongue, caught by something in Barbara's
face. "Good gracious!" she ended. "My�my
foot's asleep!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had felt her flush fading to paleness. She
felt a quick relief that none there, save Patricia and
Daunt, knew her first name. In the diversion caused
by Patricia's helpless efforts to stand up, she stole
a glance at Daunt.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A shadow had fallen on his face. He did not look
at her, but in his brain the yacht's name was ringing
like a knell. She knew Phil's brother! Austen
Ware's yacht had arrived in Yokohama on the same
day as her ship. And it was named the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>.
Yet to-night he had dreamed�what had he been
dreaming? These thoughts mixed themselves
weirdly with the gaiety and nonsense that he forced
himself to render.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara felt this with an aching sense of resentment.
What was he thinking of her? And why
should she care so fiercely? The courses passed,
but the lightness and blitheness of the scene were
somehow chilled. The decorative food: the numberless,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page205" id="page205" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
tiny cups and trays; the taper, pink-tinted
fingers that poured the warm drink; the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, the
music and lights,�all palled.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was glad when the Baroness decreed the dinner
over by repeating Patricia's experiment of painful
unfolding, and calling for her wraps.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page206" id="page206" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXV" id="chXXV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">AT THE SHRINE OF THE FOX-GOD</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> street into which they trooped seemed
an oriental opera-bouffe: swaying, chatting
people in loose, light-colored <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, some
carrying crested paper lanterns tied to the ends of
short rods: a thousand lights and hues flashing and
weaving. But for two of the party the colors had
lost their warmth and the movement its fascination.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I simply <i style="text-shadow: none;">can't</i> coop up yet in a <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>!" pleaded
Patricia, as they donned their discarded shoes.
"Why not walk a little?" The proposal met with
a chorus of approval. They set out together, and
presently Barbara found Daunt beside her. Her
resentment did not cool as she laughed and talked
mechanically, acutely aware that he was answering
in monosyllables or with silence.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt was crying out upon himself for a fool.
What right had he to feel that hot sting in his
heart? Yesterday morning he had not known that
she existed. If an hour ago the skies had been
golden-sprinkled azure, and Tokyo the capital of
an Empire of Romance, it was only because he was
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page207" id="page207" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
a boyish, silly dolt, sick with vanity and complacency.
What had there been between them, after all,
save a light camaraderie into which a man was an
insufferable cad to read more? So he paced on, achingly
cognizant of the lapses in his conversation,
quite unconscious that her own was growing more
forced and strained.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They were in the midst of a densely packed crowd
where a native theater was pouring its audience into
the street. They had fallen behind the rest, and
there were about them only <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono'd</i> shoulders
and flowered, blue-black head-dresses. He made a
way for her ruggedly toward a paling where there
was a little space. Above it was hung a poster of a
Japanese actress.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is the famous Sada Gozen," he told her.
"She has just returned from a season in Paris and
New York, and Tokyo is quite wild about her."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he spoke numbers thrust him against her and
the touch brought instantly to him that moment in
the garden when he had held her in his arms to lift
her to the arbor ledge. The picture of her that
evening in the pagoda was stamped on his heart:
the sweet, moon-lighted profile, the curling, brown
hair, the faint perfume of her gown that mingled
with the wistaria. It came before him there in the
bustle and press with a sudden swift sadness. He
knew that it would be always with him to remember.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A Japanese couple, hastening to their <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page208" id="page208" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
caromed against them, and, with an effort, he tried
to turn it to a smile:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Some say it's difficult for a foreigner to come
into intimate contact with the Japanese," he said.
"You have already pierced that illusion. One is
always finding out that he has been mistaken in
people."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her quivering feeling grasped at a fancied innuendo.
"It doesn't take long, then, you think?"
Her tone held a dangerous lure, but he did not perceive
it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not where you are concerned, apparently," he
answered lightly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned her head swiftly toward him, and her
eyes flashed. "Where <i style="text-shadow: none;">I</i> am concerned!" she repeated
fiercely, and in his astonishment he almost
wrecked the paling. "Oh, I hate double-meaning!
Why not say it? Do you suppose I don't know
what you are thinking?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I?" he said in bewilderment. "What <i style="text-shadow: none;">I</i> am
thinking?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You mean you have found you are mistaken in
<i style="text-shadow: none;">me</i>! You have no right�no earthly right, to draw
conclusions."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah!" he said, with a sharp breath. "I had no
such meaning. You can't imagine�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Don't say you didn't," she interrupted. "That
only makes it worse!" She scarcely understood her
own resentment, and a hot consciousness that her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page209" id="page209" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
behavior was quite childish and unreasonable mixed
itself with her anger.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What have I said?" he exclaimed, in contrition
and distress. "I wouldn't hurt you for a million
worlds! Whatever it was, I ought to do <i style="text-shadow: none;">hara-kiri</i>
for it! I�I will perform the operation whenever
you say!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A ridiculous desire to cry had seized her�why,
she could not have told�and she would rather have
died than have him see her do so. "If you will go
ahead," she said tremulously, "and make a path for
me, I think we can get through now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned instantly and his broad shoulders parted
the crowd in a haste that was thoroughly un-Japanese.
But she did not follow him. Instead,
she drew back, and thinking only to hide momentarily
her hurt and her pride, slipped through a
narrow gateway.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She found herself in a crowded corridor of the
emptying playhouse. The mass of Japanese faces
confused her. A door opened at another angle and
she passed through it hastily into the open air. The
street she was now in was narrow, and she followed
it, expecting it to turn into the larger thoroughfare.
It did so presently, and at its corner she paused till
the burning had left her eyes, and her breath came
evenly. Then she walked back toward the theater,
feeling an impatient irritation at her behavior.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Presently, however, she stopped, puzzled. The
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page210" id="page210" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
theater was not there. The street, too, had not the
character of the one in which she had left Daunt.
She must have taken the wrong turn. She walked
rapidly in the opposite direction, until another street
crossed at right angles. This she tried with no better
result. In the maze of lantern-lighted vistas, she
was completely lost.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was not frightened, for she was aware that,
so far as physical harm was concerned, Tokyo, of
all great cities of the world, was perhaps the safest
and most orderly. She knew that "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Bei-koku Taish'-kan</i>"
meant "American Embassy." She had mastered
the phrase that morning, and had only to step
into a <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> and use it. Daunt, however, did not
know this. Aware that she had been behind him,
he would not go on, and she contritely pictured him
anxiously searching the crowds for her. The
thought overrode her anger and humiliation. She
would not take the <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> till she despaired of
finding him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Just before her, at the side of the way, stood a
small temple with a recumbent stone fox at its
entrance. It made her think suddenly of the riding-crop
she had seen Daunt carrying, with its Damascene
fox-head handle. In the doorway burned a rack
of little candles, and a chest, barred across the top,
sat ready to receive the offerings of worshipers.
Above this was suspended the mirror which is the
invariable badge of a <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> shrine. It was tilted at
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page211" id="page211" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;211]</span>
an angle and tossed back the glimmer of the candle-flame.
With a whimsical smile she took a copper
coin from her purse and leaned to toss it into the
chest.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But her fingers closed on it and she drew back
hastily, with a quick memory of one of the tales
Haru had told her in the garden. She knew suddenly
that she stood before a temple of Inari, the
Fox-God, patron deity of her whose conquests
brought shame to households and dishonor to wives.
She remembered a song the Japanese girl had sung
to the tinkle of her <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was the song of the "Fox-Woman." She
slipped the purse hastily back into her pocket.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Fox-Woman! As she walked on, for the
first time the phrase came to Barbara with a sudden,
sharp sense of actuality. There were fox-women
of every race and clime, women who came, with
painted smile, between true lovers! What if she
herself�what if here, in this land, that baleful wisdom
were to strike home to <i style="text-shadow: none;">her</i>? Like a keen blade
the thought pierced through her, and something shy
and sweet, newborn in her breast, shrank startled
and fearful from it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The street had narrowed curiously. It was paved
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page212" id="page212" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;212]</span>
now from side to side with flat stone flags. She
realized all at once that there were no longer <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>
to be seen, only people afoot. A blaze of light
caught her eye, and she looked up to see, spanning
the street, an arched gateway, at either side of which
stood a policeman, quiet and imperturbable. Its
curved top was decorated with colored electric bulbs,
and from its keystone towered a great image molded
in white plaster�the figure of a woman in ancient
Japanese costume. One hand held a fan; the other
lifted high above her head a circular globe of light.
A huge weeping-willow drooped over one side of
the archway, through which came glimpses of moving
colors, crowds, hanging lanterns and elfish
music.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara hesitated. To what did that white, female
figure beckon? She looked behind her�direction
now meant nothing. Perhaps she had wandered
in a circle and the theater lay beyond.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She stepped through the gate.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page213" id="page213" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXVI" id="chXXVI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE NIGHTLESS CITY</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Straight</span> before her lay a wide pavement,
humming with voices, lined with three-story
houses that glowed with iron-hooped lanterns
of red, yellow and green, and tinkled with the music
of <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>. From their gaily lighted <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> swathes
of warm, yellow light fell on the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono'd</i> figures
of men strolling slowly up and down. A little way
off rose a square tower, with a white clock-face,
illumined by a circle of electric bulbs. Narrower
streets, also innocent of roadway, crossed at right
angles and at mathematical intervals. They were
starry with lamps that hung in long projecting balconies
ornamented with grill and carved work. From
these came the shrieking sounds of music and an
indescribable atmosphere of frivolity, of obvious
dedication to some flippant cult.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In and out of these side streets flowed a multitude
of boys and men, in unbelted summer robes of light
colors, lazily vivacious, moving on naked, clogged
feet, making the air a bluish haze of cigarette smoke.
In the blazing dusk they suggested the populace of
some crowded Spa strolling to the pools in flowing
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page214" id="page214" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
bath-robes and straw hats. On some of the far balconies
Barbara could see women leaning, in ornate
costumes, smoking tiny pipes. Here and there girls
strolled past her, for the most part in couples, gaudily
clad, their cheeks white with rice-powder, their
lips carmined, their blue-black hair wonderfully
coaxed and pomaded into shining wings and whorls,
thrust through with many jeweled hair-pins, like
slim daggers. They jested freely with the men they
passed, laughing continually with low voices. In a
doorway a slim girl, dressed in deep red, gleefully
tickled with one bare foot the hide of a shaggy
poodle vainly essaying slumber. As she went on,
the crowd became more numerous; men's <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
brushed Barbara's skirts and eyes stared at her with
contemplative boldness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Madame!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She felt a hand pluck her sleeve. It was a young
Japanese, in foreign dress, with a shining brown
derby, shining aureated teeth, and shining silver-handled
cane. "Madame wishes a guide?" he inquired.
She recollected him instantly as the youth
who had slipped into her hand the printed card when
she had landed from the ship at Yokohama. She did
not know the name of the theater she had left, however,
so shook her head and hurried on.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Without warning she emerged into the nun-like
quiet of a park with an acre of growing trees and
an irregular little lake that lay dark and still under
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page215" id="page215" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
the moon. Beside it was a stretch of hard, beaten
earth, seemingly a playground. Benches were set
under the trees, and among them moved or sat other
girls in costumes like those she had seen on the
pavement. At sight of Barbara's foreign dress
some of them giggled with amusement and called to
one another in repressed, laughing voices. A bell
struck somewhere, and, as though this had been a
signal, they all rose and departed, passing out by the
way Barbara had come.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She traversed the park�to come face to face with
a high palisade. She took a new direction, only to
come again on the same barrier. The park seemed
only a part of a vast inclosure into which she had
penetrated. Had this no outlet save the gate at
which she had entered? Wondering, she retraced
her steps to the lighted pavement. She was puzzled
now, and turned into one of the cross streets. Its
blaze of light, its movement and murmur of humanity
bewildered her for a moment; then what she
saw instantly arrested her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The lower stories of most of the abutting buildings
had for fronts only lattices of vertical wooden
bars, set a few inches apart. Inside these bars,
which made strange, human bird-cages, seated on
mats of brocade, or flitting here and there, were galaxies
of Japanese girls, marvelously habited in chameleon
colors�even more brilliant than the <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>
she had seen at Mukojima�like branches of iridescent
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page216" id="page216" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
humming-birds or banks of pulsing butterflies.
Here and there, a foil to the fluttering cages,
stretched a silent arcade brilliantly lighted and hung
with women's photographs. Above each was fixed a
placard with a name in Japanese characters.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">What was this place into which she had strayed?
She had heard of the famous "Street-of-the-<i style="text-shadow: none;">Geisha</i>,"
where the dancers live. Had she stumbled on
this in the throes of some festival? Why were there
no women on the pavements? She had seen none
save those in the gaudy robes whom the bell had
called away. What was the meaning of the high
palisades?�the narrow gate with its stolid policemen?�the
barred house fronts?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Projecting on to the pavement, at the side of each
building, was a small, windowed kiosk like the box-office
of a theater. In the one nearest Barbara a
man was sitting. His arm was thrust through the
window, and his hand, holding a half-opened fan,
tapped carelessly on its side while he chanted in a
coaxing voice. Inside a man with close-cropped
gray hair strode along the seated rows, striking
sharply together flint and steel, till a shower of
gleaming sparks fell on each head-dress. This done,
he emerged and paced three times up and down the
pavement, making squeaking noises with his lips,
and describing with his hands strange passes in the
air. These reminded Barbara irresistibly of a child's
cryptic gestures for luck. He then struck the flat of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page217" id="page217" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
his hand six times smartly against the door-post
and retired. She noticed that he paused at the entrance
to snuff the row of candles that burned in a
shrine beside it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The whole street, with its rows of gilded cages
was a gleaming vista of <i style="text-shadow: none;">tableaux-vivants</i>, drenched
in prismatic hues. Each, Barbara noted, had its
uniform scheme of costume: one showed the sweeping
lines and deep, flowing sleeves of the pre-<i style="text-shadow: none;">Meiji</i>
era; another the high, garnet skirt of the modern
school-girl; in one the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> were of rich mauve,
shading at the bottom to pale pink set with languorous
red peonies; in another, of gray crepe figured
with craggy pine-trees; in a third, of scarlet and
blue, woven with gold thread and embroidered in
peacock feathers. Before each inmate's cushion sat
a tiny brass <i style="text-shadow: none;">hibachi</i>, or fire-bowl, in whose ashes
glowed a live coal for the lighting of pipes and
cigarettes, and a miniature toilet-table, like a doll's-cabinet,
topped by a small, round mirror. From
tiny compartments now and then one would draw a
little box of rouge, a powder-puff of down, or an
ivory spicula, with which, in complete indifference
to observation, she would heighten the vivid red of a
lip, or smooth a refractory hair. The background
against which they posed was of heavy and exquisitely
intricate gold-lacquer carvings of stork,
dragon and phoenix, of cunningly disposed mirrors,
or of draped crimson and silver weaves. Before the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page218" id="page218" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
bars men paused to chat a moment and pass on: behind
them the gorgeous robes and tinted faces flitted
hither and thither with a magpie chatter, with
glimpses of ringed fingers clutching the lattice, and
of naked feet, slim and brown against the flooring.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara watched curiously. She was no longer
conscious that passing men studied her furtively�that
here and there, through the slender bars, a
delicate hand waved daringly to her. In all the
fairy-like gorgeousness she felt a subtle sense of
repugnance that kept her feet in the middle of the
pavement. She noted now that, however the costumes
varied, they agreed in one particular: the <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i>
of each inmate was tied, not at the back, but in
front. It seemed a kind of badge. Somewhere she
had read what it stood for. What was it?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A group of men passed her at the moment�foreigners,
speaking an unfamiliar tongue. They
talked loudly and pointed with their sticks. One of
them observed her, and turning, said something to
his companions. They looked back. One of them
laughed coarsely.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the sound, which echoed a patent vulgarity in
the allusion, the blood flew to her cheeks. The tone
had told her in a flash what the palisades, the barred
inclosures, the gaudy finery and reversed <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i> had
failed to suggest. A veil was wound about her hat
and with nervous haste she drew down its folds over
her face, feeling suddenly sick and hot. Driven now
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page219" id="page219" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
by an overpowering desire to find her way out, she
doubled desperately back to the wider street.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Madame!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned, with relief this time, to see "Mr. Y.
Nakajima," the guide, of the gold fillings and silver-topped
cane.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You are lost," he said. "Come with me, and I
will find you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She bade him take her to the gate as quickly as
possible and followed him rapidly, stung with an
acute longing for the noisy roadway with its careening
<i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>. He was a thin, humorous-looking
youth with a chocolate skin and long almond eyes,
from which he shot at Barbara glances half obsequious,
half impertinent and preternaturally sly, from
time to time making some remark which she answered
as shortly as she might.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">By the arch with its lofty female figure, under the
weeping willow, Barbara turned for an instant and
looked back. The street seemed to her a maze of
reeling lights�a blur of painted lips and drowsing
eyes and ghostly sobbing of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>. Just outside
the gate a pilgrim-priest, his coffin-like shrine
strapped on his back, was mumbling a prayer.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The guide spoke complacently: "Japan Yoshiwara
are very famed," he said. "I think other countries
is very seldom to have got."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Where do they all come from?" Barbara asked
suddenly. "How do they come to be here?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page220" id="page220" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
"From many village," he answered. He had
raised his voice, for several passers-by had paused
to listen inquisitively to the strange sounds, so uncouthly
unlike their own liquid syllabary; and he
loved to display his English. "A man have a shop.
Business become bad; he owe so plenty money. He
can not pay, but he have pretty daughter. Here they
offer maybe two, three hundred <i style="text-shadow: none;">yen</i>, for one year.
So she dutifully pay honorable father debt."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara turned away. Again she felt the edge of
mystery, bred of the unguessable divergence between
the moral Shibboleths of West and East. It caught
at her like the cool touch of dread that chills the
strayer in haunted places. In a hundred ways this
land drew her with an extraordinary attraction; now
a feeling of baffled perplexity and pain mingled with
the fascination. It was almost a sort of terror. If
in two days Japan offered such passionate variety,
such undreamed contrasts and subtleties, what
would it eventually show to her? Could she ever
really know it, understand it?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There is a theater near here where Sada Gozen
is playing," she said. "Can you take me there?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He nodded. "The <i style="text-shadow: none;">Raimon-za</i>�the Play-House-of-the-Gate-of-Thunder.
It is more five minutes of
distant."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He conducted her through a maze of narrow
streets and pointed to the building, which she saw
with a breath of relief. Taking out her purse she
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page221" id="page221" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
put a bill into his hand. "Thank you," she said,
"and good night."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I shall go with Madame at her hotel."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She shook her head. "I can find my way now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But Madame�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No," she said decidedly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He stood a moment swinging his cane, looking
after her with impudent almond eyes. Then he
lighted a cigarette, settled his derby at a jaunty angle
and sauntered back toward the Yoshiwara.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara came on Daunt in the middle of the
block. He had stationed himself in the roadway,
towering head and shoulders above the lesser stature
of the native crowds. With him was a Japanese boy
who, she noted with surprise, was Ito, one of the
house-servants. Her heart jumped as she saw the
relief spring to Daunt's anxious face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Mea culpa!</i>" she cried, and with an impulsive
gesture reached out her hand to him. "What a trouble
I have been to you! I was actually lost. Isn't
it absurd?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her slim, white fingers lay a moment in his. All
his heart had leaped to meet them. In the moment
of her anger he had not read its meaning, but since
then it had been given him partly to understand.
His thoughtless words�blunderer that he was!�had
seemed to carp at her like a whining school-boy,
with cheap, left-handed satire! Yet to his memory
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page222" id="page222" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
even her hot, indignant voice had been ringingly
sweet, for the stars again were golden, and Tokyo
once more fairy-land.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What <i style="text-shadow: none;">will</i> the others say!" she said. "They will
have missed us long ago."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"We will take extra push-men," he said, "and
easily overtake them. We can get <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> at the
next stand."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What did you think," she asked, as they rounded
the corner, "when you found I had vanished into
thin air?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I imagined for a while you were punishing me.
Then I guessed you had somehow turned into the
side street. But I felt that you would find your way
back, so�I waited."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Thank you," she said softly. "I have not acted
so badly since I was a child. Are you going to
shrive me?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am the one to ask that of you," he replied.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No�no! It is I. I must do penance. What is
it to be?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked at her steadily; his eyes shone with
dark fire. In the pause she felt her heart throb
quickly, and she laughed with a sweet unsteadiness.
"I am glad you are going to give me none," she said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But I do," he answered, "I shall. I�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The boy Ito, behind them, spoke his name. Daunt
started with a stab of recollection and drew from his
pocket a folded pink paper, fastened with a blue seal.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page223" id="page223" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
"How stupid of me! My wits have gone wool-gathering
to-night. Here is a telegram for you. It
came soon after we left the Embassy, and Mrs. Dandridge,
thinking it might be urgent, sent Ito after us
to the tea-house. He missed us, but saw me here on
his way back."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara broke the seal and held the message to
the candle-light that shone from a low temple entrance.
She did not notice at the moment that it
was the temple of the Fox-God whose alms she had
that evening denied. She had guessed who was the
sender and the knowledge fell like a cool, fateful
hand on her mood.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And alas, on Daunt's also. For, as she turned
the leaf, his gaze, wandering through the temple
doorway, to the candle-starred mirror above the
tithe-box, had unwittingly seen reflected there, in
the painfully exact chirography of a Japanese telegraph-clerk,
the signature</p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXVII" id="chXXVII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">LIKE THE WHISPER OF A BATS' WINGS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">On</span> the other side of Tokyo that night Doctor
Bersonin sat with Phil in his great laboratory.
Dinner had been laid on a round table
at one end of the room. This was now pushed into
a corner; they sat in deep leather chairs with slim
liqueur glasses of green <i style="text-shadow: none;">cr�me de menthe</i> on a
stand between them, with a methyl lamp and cigars.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil had more than once refilled his glass from the
straw-braided, long-necked vessel at his elbow. He
was restless and ill at ease. The tense excitement
that had followed his hour with Bersonin at the Club
had been allayed by the lights and movement of the
cherry-festival; but in that cool, bare room, under
the continuous, slow scrutiny of the expert's pallid,
mask-like face, the sense of half-fearful elation had
returned, reinforced by a feverish expectation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">During the dinner, served at ten, conversation had
been desultory, full of lapses broken only by the
plaintive chirp of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">hiwa</i> from its corner. When
the cigars and cordial had been brought by the silent-footed
Ishida, Bersonin had risen to draw the curtain
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page225" id="page225" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
closely over the window and to lock the door.
When he came back he stood before the mantelpiece,
his arm laid along it, looking down from his
towering height on the other's unquiet hand playing
with the chain of the spirit-lamp. His face was
very white. Phil drew a long, slow breath and
looked up.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin spoke. His voice was cold and measured;
the only sign of agitation was in the slow,
spasmodic working of the great white fingers against
the dark wood.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I have brought you here to-night," he said, "to
make you a proposition. I have need of help�of a
kind�that you can give me. It will require certain
qualities which I think you possess�which we possess
in common. I have chosen you because you
have daring and because you are not troubled by
what the coward calls conscience�that fool's name
for fear!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil touched his dry lips with his tongue. "I have
as little of that as the next man," he replied. "I
never found I needed much."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin continued:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What I have to say I can say without misgiving.
For if you told it before the fact there is possibly
but one man in Japan who would think you sane;
and if you told it after�well, for your own safety,
you will not tell it then! Your acceptance of my
proposition will have a definite effect on your prospects,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page226" id="page226" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
which, I believe, can scarcely be looked on as
bright."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil muttered an oath. "You needn't remind me
of that," he said with surly emphasis. "I've got
about as much prospects as a coolie stevedore. Well,
what of it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The cold voice went on, and now it had gathered
a sneer:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You are twenty-three, educated, good-looking,
with the best of life before you�but dependent on
the niggardly charity of a rich brother for the very
bread you eat. Even here, on this skirt of the world
where pleasures are cheap, it is only by dint of
debt that you keep your head above water. Now
your sedate relative has come to sit in judgment on
your past year. What does he care for your private
tastes? What will he do when he hears of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i> suppers and the bar-chits at the Club and the
roulette table at the bungalow? Increase that generous
stipend of yours? I fancy not."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil lit a cigar with a hand that shook. The doctor's
contemptuous words had roused a tingling anger
that raced with the alcohol in his blood. He,
with the tastes of a gentleman, as poor as a temple-rat,
while his brother sailed around the globe in his
steam-yacht! He saw his allowance cut off�saw
himself driven to the cheap expedients of the Bund
beach-comber, cringing for a <i style="text-shadow: none;">yen</i> from men who
had won his hundreds at the Roost�or perhaps
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page227" id="page227" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
sitting on an under-clerk's stool in some Settlement
counting-house, shabby-genteel, adding figures from
eight in the morning to five at night. No more
moon-light cherry-parties on the Sumida River, or
plum-blossom picnics, or high jinks in the Inland
Sea. No more pony-races at Omori, or cat-boat
sailing at Kamakura, or philandering at the Maple-Leaf
Tea-House. No more laughing Japanese faces
and tinted fingers�no more stolen kisses in bamboo
lanes�no more Haru!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He struck the stand with his fist. "And if�I
agree?" he said thickly. "What then?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin leaned forward, his hands on the stand.
It rocked under his weight. "I have talked of
money. I will show you a quick way to gain it�not
by years, but by <i style="text-shadow: none;">days</i>!�wealth such as you have
never dreamed, enough to make your brother poor
beside you! Not only money, but power and place
and honors. Is the stake big enough to play for?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil stared at him, fascinated. It was not madness
back of those dappled, yellowish eyes. They
were full of a knowledge, cold and measured and
implacable.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What do you�want me to do?" He almost
gasped the words.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The expert looked him in the eye a full moment
in silence, his fingers crawling and twitching. Then,
with a quick, leopard-like movement, he went to the
wall-safe, opened it and took out what seemed a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page228" id="page228" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
square metal box. In its top was set an indicator,
like the range-finder of a camera. Its very touch
seemed to melt his icy control. His paleness flushed;
his hand trembled as he set it upon the desk.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Wait!" he said. "Wait!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked swiftly about the room. His eye rested
on the bamboo cage and a quick gleam shot across
his face. He opened the wire door and the little bird
hopped to his finger. He moved a metal pen-rack
to the very center of the desk and perched the tiny
creature on it. It burst into song, warbling full-throated,
packed with melody. Bersonin set the
metal case a little distance away and adjusted it with
minutest care.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Sing, Dick!" he cried loudly; "sing! sing!�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The song stopped. There had come a thrill in the
air�a puff of icy wind on Phil's face�a thin chiming
like a fairy cymbal. Phil sprang up with a cry.
The fluffy ball, with its metal perch, had utterly disappeared;
only in the center of the desk was a pinch
of reddish-brown powder like the dust of an emery-wheel,
laid in feathery whorls.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He stared transfixed. "What does it mean?" he
asked hoarsely.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The doctor's voice was no longer toneless. It
leaped now with an evil exultation. "It means that
I�Bersonin�have found what physicists have
dreamed of for fifty years! I have solved the secret
of the love and hatred of atoms! That box is the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page229" id="page229" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
harness of a force beside which the engines of modern
war are children's toys."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He grasped Phil's arm with a force that made him
wince. The amber eyes glittered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"At first I planned to sell it to the highest bidder
among the powers. I was a fool to think of that!
The nation that buys it, to guard the secret for itself,
must wall me in a fortress! That would be the
reward of Bersonin�the great Bersonin, who had
wrested from nature the most subtle of her secrets!
But I am too clever for that! It must be <i style="text-shadow: none;">I</i>�<i style="text-shadow: none;">I alone</i>�who
holds the key! It shall bring me many things,
but the first of these is money. I must have funds�unlimited
funds. The money I despise, except as a
stepping-stone, but the money <i style="text-shadow: none;">you love</i> and must
have! Well, I offer it to you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's heart was beating hard. The tension of the
room had increased; a hundred suffocating atmospheres
seemed pressing on it. "How�how�" he
stammered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin took a paper from his pocket, unfolded it
and laid it on the stand. It was a chart of Yokohama
harbor. A red square was drawn in the margin,
and from this a fine, needle-like ray pointed out
across the anchorage. With his pencil the Doctor
wrote two words on the red square�"The Roost."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil shrank trembling into his chair. He seemed
to see the other looking at him over clinking glasses
at the Club, while voices spoke from the next room.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page230" id="page230" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">What if one of those Dreadnaughts should go
down in this friendly harbor!</i>" It came from his
lips in a thin whisper, almost without his volition�the
answer to the question that had haunted him
that day.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A gleam like the fire of unholy altars came in Bersonin's
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not one�<i style="text-shadow: none;">two</i>! A bolt from a blue sky, that
will echo over Europe! And what then? A fury
of popular passion in one country; suspicion and
alarm in all. Rumors of war, fanned by the yellow
press. The bottom dropping out of the market!
It means millions at a single <i style="text-shadow: none;">coup</i>, for, in spite of
diplomatic quibbles, the market is like a cork. The
Paris bourse is soaring. Wall Street will make a
new record to-morrow. In London, Consols are at
Ninety-two. My agents are awaiting my word. I
have many, for that is safer. I shall spread selling
orders over five countries�British bonds in Vienna
and New York, and steel and American railroads in
London. I risk all and you�nothing. Yet if you
join hands with me in this we shall share alike�you
and I! And with the winnings we get now
we shall get more. Trust me to know the way!
Money shall be dirt to you. The pleasure-cities of
every continent shall be your playgrounds. You
shall have your pretty little Japanese <i style="text-shadow: none;">peri</i>, and fifty
more besides."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's face had flushed and paled by turns. He
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page231" id="page231" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
looked at the expert with a shivering fascination:
"But there are�there will be�men aboard those
ships...." He shuddered and wrenched his
gaze away.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin put out his great hand and laid it on the
other's shoulder�its weight seemed to be pressing
him down into the chair.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well?" he said, in a low intense voice. "What
if there are?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a long silence. Then slowly Phil lifted
a face as white as paper. A look slinking and devilish
lay in it now.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The doctor bent down and began to speak in a
low tone. The sound passed around the room, sibilant,
like the sound of a bat's wings in the dark.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was an hour before midnight when Phil opened
the gate of the expert's house and passed down the
moon-lighted street. He walked stumblingly, cowering
at the tree-shadows, peering nervously over
his shoulder like one who feels the presence of a
ghastly familiar.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the great room he had left, Bersonin stood by
the fireplace. The nervous strain and exaltation
were still on him. He poured out a glass of the
liqueur which he had not yet tasted and drank it off.
The hot pungent mint sent a glow along his nerves.
Behind him Ishida was methodically removing the
dinner service. The doctor crossed the room and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page232" id="page232" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
stood before the bamboo cage. He drew back the
spring-door and whistling, held out his finger.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Here, Dick!" he called. "Here, boy!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was no response.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He started. His face turned a gray-green. He
drew back and stealthily turned his head.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the Japanese did not seem to have noticed the
silence. With the tray in his hands, he was looking
fixedly at the feathery sprays of reddish-yellow dust
on the polished top of the desk.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page233" id="page233" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXVIII" id="chXXVIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE FORGOTTEN MAN</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</span> pushed open the bamboo gate of
the temple garden, then paused. The recluse
with whom she had talked yesterday sat a little
way inside, while before him, in an attitude of
deepest attention, stood the diminutive figure on
the huge clogs whose morning acquaintance she had
made from her window. Thorn was looking at him
earnestly with his great myopic eye, through a heavy
glass mounted with a handle like a lorgnette.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My son," he said. "Why will you persist in eating
<i style="text-shadow: none;">am�</i>, when I have taught you the classics and
the true divinity of the universe? It is too sweet
for youthful teeth. One of these days you will be
carried to a dentist, an esteemed person with horrible
tools, prior to the removal of a small hell, containing
several myriads of lost souls, from the left
side of your lower jaw!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's foot grated on a pebble and he rose
with a startled quickness. The youngster bent double,
his face preternaturally grave. Thorn thrust
the glass into his sleeve and smiled.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am experimenting on this oriental raw material,"
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page234" id="page234" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
he said, "to illustrate certain theories of my
own. Ishikichi-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i>, though a slave to the sweetmeat
dealer, is a learned infant. He can write forty
Chinese characters and recite ten texts of Mencius.
He also knows many damnable facts about figures
which they teach in school. He has just propounded
a question that Confucius was too wise to answer:
'Why is poverty?' Not being so wise as the Chinese
sage, I attempted its elucidation. Thus endeth our
lesson to-day, Ishikichi. <i style="text-shadow: none;">Sayonara</i>."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He bowed. The child ducked with a jerky suddenness
that sent his round, battered hat rolling at
Barbara's feet. She picked it up and set it on the
shaven head.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh!" she said humbly. "I beg your pardon,
Ishikichi! I put the rim right in your eye!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Don't menshum it," he returned solemnly. "I
got another." He stalked to the gate, faced about,
bobbed over again and disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara looked after him smilingly. "Is Ishikichi
in straitened circumstances? Or is his bent
political economy?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"His father has been ill for a long time," Thorn
replied. "He keeps a shop, and in some way the
child has heard that they will have to give it up. It
troubles him, for he can't imagine existence without
it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What a pity! I would be so glad to�do you
think I could give them something?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page235" id="page235" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
He shook his head. "After you have been here
a while, you will find that simple charity in Japan is
not apt to be a welcome thing."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am beginning to understand already," she
said, as they walked along the stepping-stones, "that
these gentle-mannered people do not lack the sterner
qualities. Yet how they grace them! The iron-hand
is here, but it has the velvet glove. Courtesy
and kindness seem almost a religion with them."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"More," he answered. "This is the only country
I have seen in the world whose people, when I walk
the street, do not seem to notice that I am disfigured!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She made no pretense of misunderstanding. "Believe
me," she said gently, "it is no disfigurement.
But I understand. My father lived all his life in the
dread of blindness."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A faint sound came from him. She was aware,
without lifting her eyes to his, that he was staring at
her strangely.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"All his life. Then your father is not ...
living?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He died before I was born."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She glanced at him as she spoke, for his tone had
been muffled and indistinct. There was a deep furrow
in his forehead which she had not seen before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Do you look like him?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No, he was dark. I am like my mother."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn was looking away from her, toward the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page236" id="page236" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
lane, where, beyond the hedge, a man was passing,
half-singing, half-chanting to himself in a repressed,
sepulchral voice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My mother died, too, when I was a little girl,"
she added, "so I know really very little about him."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had forgotten to look for the Flower-of-Dream.
They had come to the little lake with its
mossy stones and basking, orange carp. Through
the gap in the shrubbery the white witchery of Fuji-San
glowed in the sun with far-faint shudderings of
lilac fire. She sat down on a sunny boulder. Thorn
stooped over the water, looking into its cool, green
depths, and she saw him pass his hand over his
brow in that familiar, half-hesitant gesture of the
day before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Will you tell me that little?" he asked. "I think
I should like to hear."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I very seldom talk about him," she said, looking
dreamily out across the distance, "but not because I
don't like to. You see, knowing so little, I used to
dream out the rest, so that he came to seem quite
real. Does that sound very childish and fanciful?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Tell me the dreams," he answered. "Mine are
always more true than facts."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He was born," she began, "in the Mediterranean�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned her head. The stone on which Thorn's
foot rested had crashed into the water. He staggered
slightly in regaining his balance, and his face
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page237" id="page237" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;237]</span>
had the pale, startled look it wore when he had first
seen her from the roadside. He drew back, and
again his hand went up across his face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he said. "Go on."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"In the Mediterranean�just where, I don't know,
but on an island�and his mother was Romaic. I
have never seen Greece, but I like to know that some
of it is in my blood. His father was American, of a
family that had a tradition of Gipsy descent. Perhaps
he was born with the 'thumb-print' on the palm
that they call the Romany mark. As a child I used
to wonder what it looked like."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She smiled up at him, but his face was turned
away. He had taken his hand from his brow, and
slipped it into his loose sleeve, and stood rigidly
erect.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I often used to try to imagine his mother. I am
sure she had a dark and beautiful face, with large,
brown eyes like a wild deer's, that used to bend
above his cradle. Perhaps each night she crossed
her fingers over him, and said�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">En to onoma tou Patros</i>," he repeated, "<i style="text-shadow: none;">kai tou
Ouiou kai tou Agiou Pneumatos!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," she said, surprised. "In the name of the
Father, Son and Holy Ghost. You know it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is the old Greek-orthodox fashion," he said
in a low voice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I should not wonder," she continued, "if she
made three little wounds on him, as a baby, as I
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page238" id="page238" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
have read Greek mothers do, to place him under the
protection of the Trinity. She must have loved
him�her first boy-baby! And I think the most of
what he was came to him from her."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thorn moved his position suddenly, and Barbara
saw his shoulders rise in a deep-taken breath.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Love of right and hatred of wrong," he said,
"admiration for the beautiful and the true, faith in
man and woman, sensitiveness to artistic things�ah,
it is most often the mother who makes men what
they are. Not our strength or power of calculation,
but her heart and power to love! In the twilight of
every home one sees the mother-souls glowing like
fireflies. I never had a picture of my mother. I
would rather have her portrait than a fortune!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His voice was charged with feeling. She felt a
strange flutter of the heart, a painful and yearning
sympathy such as she had never felt before.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I wonder what he saw from that Greek cradle,"
she resumed. "I could never fancy the room so well.
I suppose it had pictures. Do you think so?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He nodded. "And maybe�on one wall�a Greek
<i style="text-shadow: none;">ikon</i>, protected by a silver case ... I've seen
such ... that left exposed only the olive-brown
faces and hands and feet of the figures. Perhaps ... when
he was very little ... he
used to think the brown Virgin represented his
mother and the large-eyed child himself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah," she cried, and a deeper light came in her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page239" id="page239" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
eyes. "You have been in Greece! You have seen
what he saw!" But he made no reply, and after a
moment she went on:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He had never known what terror was till one day
an accident, received in play, brought him the fear
of blindness. It must have stayed with him all his
life after that, wherever he went�for he lived in
other countries. I have a few leaves of an old
diary of his ... here and there I feel it in the
lines."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She, too, fell silent. "And then�?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There my dreams end. You see how little I
know of him. I don't know why he came to Japan.
But he met my mother here and here they were
married. I should always love Japan, if only for
that."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He�died here?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"In Nagasaki. My mother went back to America,
and there I was born."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was looking out across the wide space where
the roofs sank out of sight�to the foliaged slope of
Aoyama. Suddenly a thrill, a curiously complex
motion, ran over her. Above those far tree-tops,
sailing in slow, sweeping, concentric circles, she saw
a great machine, like a gigantic vulture. She knew
instantly what it was, and there flashed before her
the memory of a day at Fort Logan when a brave
young lieutenant had crashed to death before her
eyes in a shattered a�roplane.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page240" id="page240" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
If Daunt were to fall ... what would it
mean to her! In that instant the garden about her,
Thorn, the blue sky above, faded, and she stared
dismayed into a gulf in whose shadows lurked the
disastrous, the terrifying, the irreparable. "I love
him! I love him!"�it seemed to peal like a temple-bell
through her brain. Even to herself she could
never deny it again!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She became aware of music near at hand. It
brought her back to the present, for it was the sound
of the organ in the new Chapel across the way.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Looking up, she was struck by the expression on
Thorn's face. He seemed, listening, to be held captive
by some dire recollection. It brought to her
mind that bitter cry:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"I can not but remember such things were,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i4" style="text-shadow: none;">That were most precious to me!"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She rose with a sudden swelling of the throat.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I must go now," she said. "The Chapel is to be
dedicated this morning. The organ is playing for
the service now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She led the way along the stepping-stones to the
bamboo gate. As they approached, through the interstices
of the farther hedge she could see the figure
of the Ambassador, with Mrs. Dandridge, among
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> entering the chapel door. In the temple
across the yard the baton had begun its tapping and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page241" id="page241" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
the dulled, monotonous tom-tom mingled weirdly
with the soaring harmonies of the organ.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With her hand on the paling she spoke again:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"One thing I didn't tell you. It was I who built
the Chapel. It is in the memory of my father. See,
there is the memorial window. They were putting
it in place when I came a little while ago."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was not looking at Thorn, or she would have
seen his face overspread with a whiteness like that
of death. He stood as if frozen to marble. The
morning sun on the Chapel's eastern side, striking
through its open casements, lighted the iridescent
rose-window with a tender radiance, gilding the dull
yellow aureole about the head of the Master and
giving life and glow to the face beside Him�dark,
beardless, and passionately tender�at which Thorn
was staring, with what seemed almost an agony of
inquiry.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"St. John," she said softly, "'the disciple whom
Jesus loved.'" She drew from the bosom of her
dress the locket she always wore and opened it.
"The face was painted from this�the only picture I
have of my father."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His hand twitched as he took it. He looked at it
long and earnestly�at the name carved on its lid.
"Barbara�Barbara Fairfax!" he said. She thought
his lips shook under the gray mustache.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You�are a Buddhist, are you not?" she asked.
"And Buddhists believe the spirits of the dead are
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page242" id="page242" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
always about us. Do you think�perhaps�he sees
the Chapel?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He put her locket into her hands hastily. "God!"
he said, as if to himself. "He will see it through
a hundred existences!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her eyes were moist and shining. "I am glad
you think that," she said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the Chapel the bishop's gaze kindled as it went
out over the kneeling people.</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">We beseech Thee, that in this place now set apart
to Thy service, Thy holy name may be worshiped in
truth and purity through all generations.</i>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The voice rang valiant and clear in the summer
hush. It crossed the still lane and entered a window
where, in a temple loft, a man sat still and gray
and quiet, his hands clenched in his <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> sleeves:</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">We humbly dedicate it to Thee, in the memory
of one for the saving of whose soul Thou wert lifted
upon the Cross.</i>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The man in the loft threw himself on his face
with a terrible cry.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My child!" he cried in a breaking voice. "My
little, little child, whom they have robbed me of�whom
I have never known in all these weary years!
You have grown away from me�I shall never have
you now! Never ... never!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page243" id="page243" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
Behind him the unfinished image of Kwan-on the
All-Pitying, tossed the sunlight about the room in
golden-lettered flashes, and beneath his closed and
burning lids these seemed to blend and weave�to
form bossed letters which had stared at him from
the rim of the rose-window:</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;">THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GODS BEFORE ME.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page244" id="page244" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXIX" id="chXXIX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">DAUNT LISTENS TO A SONG</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> day had dawned sultry, with a promise
of summer humidity, and Daunt was not
surprised to find the barometer performing
intemperate antics. "Confound it!" he muttered
irritably, as he dressed. "If it was a month later,
one would think there was a typhoon waltzing
around somewhere in the China Sea."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">That morning had seen his first trial of his new
fan-propeller, and the Glider's action had surpassed
his wildest expectation. The flight, of which Barbara
had caught a glimpse from Thorn's garden, had
been a longer one than usual�quite twelve miles
against a sluggish upper current�but even that
failed to bring its customary glow. Thereafter he
had spent a long morning immersed in the work of
the Chancery: the study of a disputed mining concession
in Manchuria; a report on a contemplated
issue of government bonds; a demand for a passport
by a self-alleged national with a foreign accent and
a paucity of naturalization papers; the daily budget
of translations from vernacular newspapers, by
which a home government gains a bird's-eye view
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page245" id="page245" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
of comment and public opinion in far-away capitals.
The Chancery was a pleasant nest of rooms opening
into one another. Through its windows stole
the smell of the garden blossoms, and across the
compound wall sounded the shrill ventriloquistic
notes of peddlers, the brazen chorus of a marching
squad of buglers, or the warning "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Hek! Hek!</i>" of a
flying <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>. The main room was cool, furnished
with plain desks and filing cabinets. Against
one wall yawned a huge safe in which were kept the
code-books and records, and framed pictures of
former Chiefs of Mission hung on the walls. In
the anteroom Japanese clerks and messengers sat
at small tables. The place was pervaded by the
click of type-writer keys, tinkling call-bells, and the
various notes of a busy office, and floating down
from a stairway came the buzzing monotone of a
Student Interpreter in his mid-year oral examinations
under the Japanese secretary.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But to-day Daunt could not exorcise with the
mass of detail the leering imps that plagued him.
They peered at him over the edge of the code-books
and whispered from the margins of decorous despatches,
chuckling satirically.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara!" they sneered. "Mere acquaintances
often name steam-yachts for girls, don't they! Arrived
the same day as her ship, eh? Rather singular
coincidence! What a flush she had when Voynich
spoke of Phil's brother last night at the tea-house.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page246" id="page246" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
Angry? Of course she was! What engaged girl
likes to have the fact paraded�especially when
she's practising on another man? And how about
the telegram? How long have you known her, by
the way? Two days? Really, now!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The weekly governmental pouch had closed at
noon, and pouch-days were half-holidays, but Daunt
did not go to the Embassy. An official letter had
arrived from Washington which must be delivered
in Kamakura. Daunt seized this excuse, plunged
ferociously into tweeds and an hour afterward found
himself in a railway carriage thudding gloomily
toward the lower bay. In his heart he knew that
he was trying to run away�from something that
nevertheless traveled with him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sky was palely blue, without a cloud, but the
bay, where the rails skirted it, was heaving in long
swells of oily amethyst like a vast carpet shaken at
a distance in irregular undulations, on which <i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i>
with flapping, windless sails, of the deep gold color
of old straw, tumbled like ungainly sea-spiders. The
western hills looked misty and uncertain, and Fuji
was wrapped in a wraith-like mist into which its
glimmering profile disappeared.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At a way-station a coolie with a huge tray piled
with neat, flat, wooden boxes passed the window
calling "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ben-to! Ben-to!</i>" It reminded Daunt that
he had had no luncheon, and he bought one. He
had long ago accustomed himself to Japanese food
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page247" id="page247" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
and liked it, but to-day the two shallow sections inspired
no appetite. The half which held the rice he
viciously threw out of the window and unrolling
the fresh-cut chop-sticks from their paper square,
rummaged discontentedly among the contents of
the other: dried cuttlefish, bean-curd, slices of boiled
lily-bulb, cinnamon-sticks, lotos stems and a coil of
edible seaweed, all wrapped in green leaves. In
the end, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">m�lange</i> followed the rice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At Kamakura an immediate answer to the letter
he brought was not forthcoming, and to kill the
time he strolled far down the curved beach. The
usual breeze was lacking. A haze as fine as gossamer
had drawn itself over the sky, and through
it gulls were calling plaintively. Here and there on
the sea-wall women were spreading fish-nets, and
along the causeway trudged blue-legged peasant-women,
their backs bent beneath huge loads of
brushwood. In one place a bronze-faced fisherman
in a fantastic <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> on which was painted sea-monsters
and hobgoblins in crimson and orange,
seated on the gunwale of his <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i> drawn above
the shingle, watched a little girl who, with clothing
clutched thigh-high, was skipping the frothy ripples
as if they were ropes of foam. A mile from
the town he met a regiment of small school-boys, in
indigo-blue and white <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, marching two and
two like miniature soldiers, a teacher in European
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page248" id="page248" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
dress at either end of the line�future Oyamas,
Togos and Kurokis in embryo.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They were coming from Enoshima, the hill-island
that rises in the bay like an emerald St. Michael,
where in a rocky cave, looking seaward, dwells holy
Ben-ten, the Buddhist Goddess of Love. Daunt
could see its masses of dark green foliage with their
pink veinings of cherry-trees, and the crawling line
of board-walk, perched on piling, which gave access
from the mainland when the tide was in. On its
height, if anywhere, would be coolness. He filled
his pipe and set off toward it along the sultry sand.
The hot dazzle of the sun was in his face. There
was no movement in the crisp leaves of the bamboo
trees and the damp heat beat up stiflingly from the
gray glare. Somewhere in the air, stirless and humid,
there rested a faint, weedy smell like a steaming
sea-growth in a tidal ooze.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt's pipe sputtered feebly, and, girding at the
heat, he hurled it at a handful of blue ducks that
plashed tiredly in the gray-green heave, and watched
them dive, to reappear far away, like bobbing corks.
He wished he could as easily scatter the blue-devils
that dogged him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He drew a sigh of relief as he reached the long
elevated board-walk and shook the sand from his
shoes. Underneath its shore-end a fisherman sat in
the stern of a boat fishing with cormorants. A row
of the solemn birds sat on a pole projecting over the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page249" id="page249" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
water, each tethered by a string whose end was tied
to the man's wrist. They seemed to be asleep, but
now and then one would plunge like a diver, to
reappear with a fish wriggling in its beak. Daunt
watched them listlessly a moment, then, passing
beneath a great bronze <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i>, he slowly climbed the
single shaded street that staggered up the hill between
the multitudes of gay little shops running
over with colored sea-shells, with grotesque lanterns
made of inflated fish-skins, with carved crystal
and pink and white coral�up and up, by old, old
flights of mossy steps, under more ancient trees,
by green monuments and lichen-stippled Buddhas,
till the sea below crawled like a wrinkled counterpane.
Daunt knew a tea-house on the very
lip of the cliff, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kinki-ro</i>�"Inn of the Golden
Turtle"�and he bent his steps lazily in its direction.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the heavy heat the low tile roof looked cool
and inviting. Tall soft-eyed iris were standing in
its garden overlooking the water, and against the
green their velvety leaves made vivid splashes of
golden blue. On a dead tree two black crows were
quarreling and cherry-petals powdered the paths
like pink hail. The haze, sifting from the sky,
seemed to wrap everything in a vast, shimmering
veil. At the hedge he paused an instant. Some one,
somewhere, was humming, low-voiced, an air that
he had once loved. He pushed open the gate and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page250" id="page250" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
went on into the tremulous radiance. Then he
stopped short.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara was seated above him in the fork of a low
camelia tree, one arm laid out along a branch, her
green gown blending with a bamboo thicket behind
her and her vivid face framed in the blossoms.
She sat, chin in hand, looking dreamily out across
the bay, and the hummed song had a rhythm that
seemed to fit her thought�slow and infinitely tender.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You!" he cried.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned with a startled movement that dissolved
into low, delicious laughter.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Fairly caught," she answered. "I don't often
revert far enough to climb trees, but I thought no
one but Haru and I was here. Will you come and
help me down, Honorable Fly-man?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Wait�" he said. "What was the song you were
humming?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked at him with a quick intake of breath,
then for answer began to sing, in a voice that presently
became scarce more than a whisper:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"Forgotten you? Well, if forgetting</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">Be hearing all the day</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">Your voice through all the strange babble</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">Of voices grave, now gay�</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">If counting each moment with longing</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">Till the one when I see you again,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">If this be forgetting, you're right, dear!</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i2" style="text-shadow: none;">And I have forgotten you then!"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page251" id="page251" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
Daunt's hand fell to his side. A young girl's face
nested in creamy, pink blossoms�a sweet, shy,
flushed face under a mass of curling, gold-bronze
hair. "I remember now!" he said in a low voice.
"I ... sang it to you ... that day!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am flattered!" she exclaimed. "The day before
yesterday you had forgotten that you ever saw
poor little me! It was Mrs. Claybourne, of course,
that you sang to! Yet you were my idol for a long
month and a day!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was to <i style="text-shadow: none;">you</i>," he said unsteadily. "I didn't
know your name. But I never forgot the song. I
remembered it that night in the garden, when I
first heard you playing!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page252" id="page252" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;252]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXX" id="chXXX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE ISLAND OF ENCHANTMENT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">They</span> walked together around the curving
road, leaving Haru with the tea-basket.
"Patsy would have come," Barbara had said,
"but she is in the clutches of her dressmaker." And
Daunt had answered, "I have a distinct regard for
that Chinaman!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His black mood had vanished, and the leering
imps had flown. In the brightness of her physical
presence, how baseless and foolish seemed his sullen
imaginings! What man who owned a steam yacht,
knowing her, would not wish to name it the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>?
Walking beside her, so near that he could
feel the touch of her light skirt against his ankles,
it seemed impossible that he should ever again be
other than light-hearted. She was no acquaintance
of hours, after all. He had known her for seven
years. He was in wild spirits.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sky was duller now. Its marvelous haze of
blue and gold had turned pallid, and the sun glared
with a pale, yellowish effrontery. A strange sighing
was in the air, so faint, however, that it seemed
only the stirring of innumerable leaves, the resinous
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page253" id="page253" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
rasping of pine-needles and the lisping fall of the
flaming petals from the century-old camelia trees,
that stained the ground with hot, bleeding red. Far
below in the shallow pools, nut-brown, bare-legged
girls were gathering seaweed in hand-nets, <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
tucked beneath their belts and scarlet petticoats falling
to their knees, like a flock of brilliant flamingos.
At a turn in the road stood a stone image of Jizo,
with a red paper bib about its neck. Before it lay
three small rice-cakes; somewhere in the neighborhood
was a little sick child, three years old. At its
base were heaps of tiny stones, piled by mothers
whose little children had died.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They stopped at a tea-house open on all sides, and,
sitting cross-legged on its <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i>, drank tea from
earthenware pots that held only a small cupful,
while they listened to a street minstrel beating on a
tom-tom, and singing a mysterious song that seemed
about to choke him. They fed a crisp rice-cake to a
baby sagging from an urchin's shoulder. A doll
was strapped to the baby's back. They peered into
a Buddhist temple where a monotonous chant came
from behind a blue-figured curtain. They went,
laughing like two children, down the zigzag stone
steps, past innumerable <i style="text-shadow: none;">uomitei</i>�crimson-benched
"resting-houses," where grave Japanese pedestrians
sat eating stewed eels and chipping hard-boiled
eggs�to the rocky edge of the tide, which now
rolled in with a measured, sullen booming. He
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page254" id="page254" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
pointed to a gloomy fissure which ran into the
mountain, at a little distance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"O Maiden, journeying to Holy Ben-ten," he
said, "behold her shrine!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How disillusioning!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"People find love so, sometimes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She slowly shook her head. "Not all of them,"
she said softly. "I am old-fashioned enough not to
believe that." Her brown eyes were wistful and a
little troubled, and her voice was so adorable that
he could have gone on his knees to her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"We will ask Ben-ten about it," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh, but not '<i style="text-shadow: none;">we!</i>'" she cried. "I must go alone.
Don't you know the legend? People quarrel if they
go together."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I can't imagine quarreling with you. I'd rather
quarrel with myself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That would be difficult, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not in some of my moods. Ask my head-boy.
to-day, for instance�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well?" For he had paused.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I was meditating self-destruction when I met
you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"By what interesting method, I wonder?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I was about to search for a volcano to jump
into."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I thought the nearest active crater is a hundred
miles away."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So it is, but I'm an absent-minded beggar."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page255" id="page255" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
She laughed. "May I ask what inspired to-day's
suicidal mood?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was�a telegram."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Oh!" She colored faintly. "I�I hope it held
no bad news."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked into her eyes. "I hope not," he said.
Something else was on his tongue, when "Look!"
she exclaimed. "How strange the sea looks off
there!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A sinister, whitish bank, like a mad drift of smoke,
lay far off on the water, and a tense, whistling hum
came from the upper air. A drop of water splashed
on Daunt's wrist. "There's going to be a blow,"
he said. "The seaweed gatherers are all coming
in, too. Ben-ten will have to wait, I'm afraid. See�even
her High Priest is forsaking her!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From where they stood steps were roughly hewn
into the rock, winding across the face of the cliff.
Beside these, stone pillars were socketed, carrying
an iron chain that hung in rusted festoons. Along
this precarious pathway from the cavern an old man
was hastily coming, followed by a boy with a sagging
bundle tied in a white cloth. "That parcel, no
doubt," said Daunt, "contains the day's offerings.
Wait! You're not going?" For she had started
down the steps.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had turned to answer, when, with the suddenness
of an explosion, a burst of wind fell on
them like a flapping weight, spattering them with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page256" id="page256" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span>
drops that struck the rock as if hurled from a sling-full
of melted metal. Barbara had never in her life
experienced anything like its ferocity. It both
startled and angered her, like a personal affront.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt had sprung to her side and was shouting
something. But the words were indistinguishable;
she shook her head and went on stubbornly, clinging
to the chain, a whirl of blown garments. She
felt him grasp her arm.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Go back!" she shrieked. "It's�bad�luck!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he released her there came a second's menacing
lull, and in it she sprang down the steps and ran
swiftly out along the pathway. He was after her
in an instant, overtaking her on a frail board trestle
that spanned a pool, where the cliff was perpendicular.
Here the wind, shaggy with spume, hurled
them together. Daunt threw an arm about her,
clinging with the other hand to the wooden railing.
Her hair was a reddish swirl across his shoulder and
her breath, panting against his throat, ridged his
skin with a creeping delight. The rocks beneath
them, through whose fissures tongues of water ran
screaming, was the color of raspberries and tawny
with seaweed. There was only a weird, yellow
half-light, through which the gale howled and scuffled,
like dragons fighting. A slather of wave licked
the palsied framework.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He bent and shouted into her ear. All she caught
was: "Must�cave�next lull�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page257" id="page257" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
She nodded her head and her lips smiled at him
through the confused obscurity. A thrill swept her
like silver rain. Pulse on pulse, an emotion like fire
and snow in one thrilled and chilled her. She closed
her eyes with a wild longing that the wind might
last for ever, that that moment, like the ecstasy of an
opium dream, might draw itself out to infinite
length. Slowly she felt the breath of the tempest
ebb about them, then suddenly felt herself lifted
from her feet, and her eyes opened into Daunt's.
Her cheek lay against his breast, as it had done in
that short moment in the Embassy garden. She
could feel his heart bound under the rough tweed.
Once more the wind caught them, but he staggered
through it, and into the high, rock entrance of the
cave.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Inside its dripping rim the sudden cessation of the
wind seemed almost uncanny, and the boom of the
surf was a dull thunderous roar. He set her on her
feet on the damp rock and laughed wildly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Do you realize," she said, "that we have transgressed
the most sacred tenet of Ben-ten by coming
here together? We are doomed to misunderstanding!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Now that I recollect, that applies only to lovers,"
he answered. "Then we�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Are quite safe," she quickly finished for him.
"Come, I want to see the shrine. We must find a
candle."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page258" id="page258" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
He peered into the gloomy depths. "I think I see
some burning," he said. "We will explore."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A little way inside they came to a small well, with
a dipper and a rack of thin blue-and-white towels to
cleanse the hands of worshipers. On a square pedestal
stood a stone Buddha, curiously incrusted by drippings
from the roof. Near it was a wooden booth,
its front hung with pendents of twisted rice-straw
and strips of white paper folded in diagonal notches.
It held a number of tiny wooden <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i> strung with
lighted candles, above each of which was nailed a
paper prayer. A few copper coins lay scattered beneath
them. Daunt thrust two of the candles into
wooden holders and they slowly followed the narrowing
fissure, guttered by the feet of centuries, between
square posts bearing carven texts, and small
images, coated with the spermy droppings from innumerable
candles.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She held up her winking light toward his face.
"What a desperate absorption!" she said laughingly.
"You haven't said a thing for five minutes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm thinking we had better explain at once to
Ben-ten that we're not lovers. Otherwise we may
get the penalty. Perhaps we'd better just tell her
it was an accident, and let it go at that? What do
you think?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That might be the simplest."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"All right then, I'll say 'Ben-ten, dear, she wanted
to come alone; she really did! We didn't intend it
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page259" id="page259" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
at all. So be a nice, gracious goddess and don't
make her quarrel with me!'"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What do you suppose she will answer?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"She will say: 'Young man, in the same circumstances,
I should have done exactly the same myself.'"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The passage had grown so low that they had to
bend their heads, then all at once it widened into a
concave chamber. The cannonading of the wind
rumbled fainter and fainter. He took her hand and
drew her forward. "There is Ben-ten," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Goddess of Love sat in a barred cleft of the
rock, enshrined in a dull, gold silence. Beads of
moisture spangled her robe, glistening like brilliants
through the mossy darkness. "Poor deity!" said
Barbara. "To have to live for ever in a sea-cavern!
It's a clammy idea, isn't it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That's�" He paused. "I could make a terrible
pun, but I won't."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"One shouldn't joke about love," she said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Have <i style="text-shadow: none;">you</i> discovered that too?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She gazed at him strangely, without answering.
In the wan light his face looked pale. Her unresisting
fingers still lay in his; he felt their touch like
a breath of fire through all his veins. Her eyes
sparkled back the eery witch-glow of the candle-flames.
"You are a green-golden gnome-girl!" he
said unsteadily. "And I am under a spell."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes, yes," she said. "I am Rumptydudget's
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page260" id="page260" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
daughter! I have only to wave my candlestick�so!�to
turn you into a stalagmite!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She suited the action to the word�and dropped
her candle, which was instantly extinguished on the
damp floor. Bending forward to retrieve it, Daunt
slipped. The arm he instinctively threw out to save
himself struck the wall and his own candle flew from
its socket. As he regained his footing, confused by
the blank, enfolding darkness, he stumbled against
Barbara, and his face brushed hers. In another
instant the touch had thrilled into a kiss.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A moment she lay in his arms, passive, panting,
her unkissed mouth stinging with the burn of his
lips. The world was a dense blackness, shot with
fire and full of pealing bells, and the beating of her
heart was a great wave of sound that throbbed like
the iron-shod fury of the seas.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I love you, Barbara!" he said simply. "I love
you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The stammering utterance pierced the swift, confused
sweetness of that first kiss like a lance of desperate
gladness. Through the tumbling passion of
the words he poured into her heart, she could feel
his hands touching her face, her throat, her loosened
hair.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara! Listen, dear! I must say it! It's
stronger than I am�no, don't push me away! Love
me! You <i style="text-shadow: none;">must</i> love me!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With her arms on his breast, she had made a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page261" id="page261" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
movement to release herself. "We are mad, I
think!" she breathed.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Then may we never be sane!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I�you have known me only two days!
What�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah, no! I've known you all these years and
have been loving you without really knowing it. I
made a woman out of my own fancy, that I dreamed
alive. In the long winter evenings when I worked
at my models in the little house in Aoyama, I used
to see her face in my driftwood blaze and talk to
her. I called her my 'Lady of the Many-Colored
Fires.' I never thought she really existed, but that
first night in the Embassy garden I knew that my
dream-woman was you!�<i style="text-shadow: none;">you</i>, Barbara!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her hands pushed him from her no more. They
fell to trembling on his breast. In the dense, salty
obscurity, she turned her head sharply, to feel again
his lips on hers, her own molding to his kiss. She
drooped, swaying, stunned, breathless.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara, I love you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No�not again. Light�the candle."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Just a moment longer�here in the dark, with
Ben-ten. It's fate, darling! Why should I have
been in Japan and not in Persia when you came?
Why did I happen to be there in the garden that
night, at that particular moment? Why, it was the
purest accident that I came here to-day! No�not
accident. It was kismet! Barbara!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page262" id="page262" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
"Make�a light. I�beg you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His lips were murmuring against her cheek. "Say
'I love you,' too!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I�can not. You ... you would hold me
cheap ... I would be�I am!... What?
Yes, it was a tulip tree. I was sixteen.... Oh,
you couldn't have�why, you'd forgotten the whole
thing! You had, you <i style="text-shadow: none;">had</i>!... Don't hold me....
No, I don't care what you think!...
Yes, I <i style="text-shadow: none;">do</i> care!... Yes, I�I ... This is
perfectly shameless!... Dark? That makes it
all the worse. What will you ... No, no! You
must not kiss me again! We must go back!�I will
go back...."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She freed herself, and he fumbled for his fallen
candle. He struck a match. The sputtering blue
flame lit her white, languorous face, her fallen hair,
her heaving breast. It went out. He struck another
and the wick blazed up.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Look at me, dear!" he said. "Tell me in the
light. Will you marry me?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I can not answer�now."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why? Don't you love me?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I�in so short a time, how could I? Let us go
now. I don't know myself�nor�nor you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was trembling, and he noted it with a pang
of compunction.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"To-morrow, sweetheart? Will you give me my
answer then?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page263" id="page263" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes!" It was almost inaudible.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"At the Foreign Minister's ball to-morrow night?
I'll come to you there, dearest. I�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He stopped. She had caught her hand to her
throat with a wild gesture. "Ben-ten! She�she is
frowning at us! There�look there!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My poor darling!" he said. "You are nervous.
See, it was only the shadow! I ought not to have
brought you into this dismal hole! You are positively
shivering."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Let us hurry," she said, and they went quickly
into the warmer air and light of the entrance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The squall had passed with the fateful swiftness
of its coming. The waves still gurgled and tumbled,
but the fury of the wind was over. The murk light
had lifted, showing the wet sky a patchy drab, which
again was beginning to show glimpses of golden
hue.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They walked back to Haru at the tea-house, beneath
the wild, poignant beauty of disheveled cryptomeria,
echoing once more the eternal song of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">semi</i>�along paths strewn with drenched petals and
sweet with the moist scents of sodden leaves�then
together, down the steep, templed hill and across
the planked walk to the mainland, where a trolley
buzzed through the springing rice-fields, musical
now with the <i style="text-shadow: none;">m� kayui</i>�<i style="text-shadow: none;">m� kayui</i> of the frogs.
Daunt accompanied them to the through line of the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page264" id="page264" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
railway. From there he was to return to Kamakura
for the answer to his letter.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sun was setting when the Tokyo express
pulled into the station. As Haru disappeared into
the compartment, Daunt took Barbara's hand to help
her to the platform. There had been no other first-class
passengers to embark and the forward end of
the asphalt was deserted. Her lovely, flushed face
was turned toward him, and there in the dusk of the
station, he bent swiftly and kissed her once more on
the lips.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Dearest, dearest!" he said behind his teeth, and
turned quickly away.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the car, as the train fled through the glory of
the sunset, Barbara closed her eyes, the longer to
keep the impression of that eager gaze: the lithe,
muscular poise of the strong frame, the parted lips,
the brown hair curling under the peak of the cloth
cap. She tried to imagine him on his backward
journey. Now the trolley had passed the rice-fields,
now he was striding along the shore road toward
Kamakura, where the great bronze Buddha was lifting
its face of dreamless calm. Now, perhaps, he
was turning back toward the deepening blur of the
green island. She shivered a little as she remembered
the frown that had seemed to rest on the stony
countenance of Ben-ten in her cave.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her thought drifted into to-morrow, when she
was to give him her answer. Ah, she knew what
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page265" id="page265" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span>
that answer would be! She thought of the telegram
of the night before, which she had read in the
candle-lighted street! To-morrow Ware also was
coming�for an answer! She knew what that
would be, too. She felt a sudden pity for him. Yet
she knew now�what wisdom she had gained in
these two swift days!�that his was not the love
that most deserved it. Daunt's parting kiss clung
to her lips like a living flower. The hand he had
clasped still burned to his touch; she lifted it and
held it against her hot face, while the darkening
carriage seemed to fill with the dank smell of salty
wind and seaweed, mingled with his voice:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara, I love you!�Dearest! Dearest!"</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She thought the gesture unseen, unguessed by
any one. But in the forward car, beyond the glass
vestibule door, which to her was only a trembling
mirror, a man sat watching with burning eyes. He
had been gazing through the window when the
train stopped, had risen to his feet with instant
recognition�to shrink back into his seat, his fingers
clenched, his bitten lip indrawn, and a pallor on his
face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was Austen Ware, and he had seen that kiss.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page266" id="page266" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXI" id="chXXXI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE COMING OF AUSTEN WARE</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Dusk</span> purpled over the rice-fields as the train
sped on. Still the man who had witnessed
that farewell sat crouched in his seat in the
forward car, stirless and pallid.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From boyhood Austen Ware had trod a calculate
path. Judicious, masterful, possessed, he had gone
through life with none of the temptations that had
lain in wait for his younger brother Phil. These
traits were linked to a certain incapacity for bad
luck and an unwearying tenaciousness of purpose.
Seldom had any one seen his face change color, had
seldom seen his poise of glacial complacency shaken.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">To-night, however, the oil lamps which glowed
dully in the ceiling of the carriage threw their faint
light on a face torn with passion. Barbara's beauty,
whose perfect indifference no touch of sentimental
passion had devitalized, had, from the first, aroused
Ware's stubborn sense of conquest. He had been
too wise to make missteps�had put ardor into the
background, while surrounding her with tactful and
graceful observances which unconsciously usurped
a large place in her thought. In the end he had
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page267" id="page267" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
broken down an instinctive disinclination and converted
it into liking.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But this was all. For the rest he had perforce
been content to wait. Thus matters had stood when
they parted a few months ago. He recalled the day
he had sailed for Suez. Looking back across the
widening water, he had conceived then no possibility
of ultimate failure. "How beautiful she is!" he had
said to himself. "She will marry me. She does
not love me, but she cares for no other man. She
will marry me in Japan." There had been nobody
else then!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he peered out into the glooming dusk all kinds
of thoughts raced through his mind. Who was the
man? Was this the resurrection of an old "affair"
that he had never guessed? No, when he left her,
Barbara had been fancy free! It was either a
"steamer acquaintance," or one come to quick fruition
on a romantic soil. He took out a cigar-case
and struck a match with shaking fingers. Had it
even come to clandestine <i style="text-shadow: none;">rendezvous</i>? She had gone
one way, the man another! A whirl of rage seized
him: the slender metal snapped short off in the
fierce wrench of his fingers. He thrust the broken
case into his pocket with a muttered curse that sat
strangely on his fastidious tongue.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Gradually, out of the wrack emerged his dominant
impulse, caution. He had many things to
learn; he must find out how the land lay. He must
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page268" id="page268" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
move slowly, re�stablish the old, easy, informal
footing. Above all he must lay himself open to no
chance of a definite refusal. A plan began to take
shape. His telegram had told her he would arrive
in Tokyo next day. Meanwhile he would find out
what Phil knew.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He left the train at Yokohama under cover of the
crowd. In a half-hour he was aboard his yacht.
Two hours later he sat down to order his dinner on
the terrace of the hotel, cool, unruffled, immaculately
groomed. The place was brightly barred with the
light from the tall dining-room windows, and the
small, round tables glowed with <i style="text-shadow: none;">andons</i> whose candle-light
shone on men's conventional black-and-white,
and women's fluttering gowns. There was
no wind�only the long, slow breath of the bay that
seemed sluggish with the scents of the tropical evening.
A hundred yards from the hotel front great
floating wharves had been built out into the water.
They were gaily trimmed with bunting and electric
lights in geometrical designs. A series of arches
flanked them, and these were covered with twigs of
ground pine. Ware had guessed these decorations
were for the European Squadron of Dreadnaughts,
of whose arrival to-day's newspapers had been full.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he looked over the <i style="text-shadow: none;">menu</i>, a man sitting near-by
rose and came to him with outstretched hand. He
was Commander DeKay, a naval <i style="text-shadow: none;">attach�</i> whom
Ware had known in Europe. They had met again,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page269" id="page269" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
a few days since, at Kyoto. He hospitably insisted
on the other's joining his own party of five.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware was not gregarious, and to-night was in a
sullen mood. But, with his habitual policy, he thrust
this beneath the surface and in another moment was
bowing to the introductions: Baroness Stroloff, her
sister, a chic young matron whose natural habitat
seemed to be Paris; the ubiquitous and popular
Count Voynich, and a statuesque American girl,
whose name Ware recognized as that of a clever
painter of Japanese children. He looked well in
evening dress, and his dark beard, thick curling
pompadour and handsome eyes added a something
of distinction to a well-set figure.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So you have just arrived, Mr. Ware?" the Baroness
said. "I hope you're not one of those terrible
two-days-in-Japan tourists who spoil all our prices
for us."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I expect to stay a month or more," he said.
"And as for prices, I shall put up as good a battle
as I can."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You know," said the artist, with an air of imparting
confidential information, "everybody is
scheduled in Tokyo. If you belong to an Embassy
you have to pay just so much more for everything.
In the Embassies, 'number-one-man' pays more than
'number-two-man,' and so on down. You and I are
lucky, Mr. Ware. We are not on the list, and can
fight it out on its merits."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page270" id="page270" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
"Belonging to the rankless file has its advantages
in Japan, then."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Not at official dinners, I assure you," interposed
the Baroness' sister with a shrug. "It means the
bottom of the table, and sitting next below the same
student-interpreter nine times in the season. I have
discovered that I rank with, but not above, the
dentist."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You tempt me to enter the service�in the lowest
grade," said Ware, and the Baroness laughed and
shook her fan at him reprovingly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sky above their heads was pricked out with
pale stars, like cat's-eye pins in a greenish-violet
tapestry. Up and down the roadway went shimmering
<i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, and Japanese couples in light <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
strolled along the bay's edge, under the bent
pines, their low voices mingled with the soft lapping
of the tide. Now and then a bicycle would pass
swiftly, bare sandaled feet chasing its pedals, and
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> sleeves flapping like great bats'-wings from
its handle-bars; or a flanneled English figure would
stride along, with pipe and racquet, from late tennis
at the recreation-ground. From the corner came
the cries of romping children and the tapping staff
and double flute-note of a blind <i style="text-shadow: none;">masseur</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The talk flew briskly hither and thither, skimming
the froth of the capital's <i style="text-shadow: none;">causerie</i>: recent additions
to the official set, the splendid new ball-room at
the German Embassy, and the increasing importance
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page271" id="page271" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;271]</span>
of Tokyo as a diplomatic center�the coming Imperial
"Cherry-Viewing Garden-Party," and the annual
Palace duck-hunt at the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shin-Hama</i> preserve,
where the game is caught, like butterflies, in scoop-nets�the
new ceremonial for Imperial audiences�whether
a stabbing affray between two Legation
<i style="text-shadow: none;">bettos</i> would end fatally, and whether the Turkish
Minister's gold dinner service was solid�and a little
scandalous surmise regarding the newest continental
widow whose stay in Japan had been long and her
dinners anything but exclusive�a rumored engagement,
and�at last!�the arrival of the new beauty
at the American Embassy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"A <i style="text-shadow: none;">real one</i>!" commented Voynich, screwing his
eye-glass in more tightly. "And that means something
in the tourist season."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware's fingers flattened on the stem of his glass
of yellow chartreuse as the artist said: "We are in
the throes of a new sensation at present, Mr. Ware;
a case of love at first sight. It's really a lot rarer
than the novelists make out, you know! We are
all tremendously interested."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But he knows her," said Voynich. "The other
evening in Tokyo, Mr. Ware, Miss Fairfax mentioned
having met you. She is from Virginia, I
think."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware bowed. "She is very good to remember
me," he said. "And so Miss Fairfax has met her
fate in Japan?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page272" id="page272" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;272]</span>
"Well, rather!" said the artist. "I hear betting is
even that she'll accept him inside a fortnight."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware sipped his liqueur with a tinge of relief.
Evidently the world of Tokyo had not yet discovered
that the new arrival's first name was that of
his yacht.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Daunt doesn't play according to Hoyle," grumbled
Voynich. "She's a guest of his own chief and
he ought to give the others half a chance. He lives
in the Embassy Compound, too, confound him! He
monopolized her outrageously at the Review the
other day! He's an American 'trust.' I shall challenge
him."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The voice of DeKay broke in:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Coppery hair and pansy-brown eyes, a skin like
a snowdrift caught blushing, and a mouth like the
smile of a red flower! A girl that Romney might
have loved, slim and young and thoroughbred�there
you have the capital sentence of the Secretary
of the American Embassy!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Down the middle of the street came running a
boy, bare-legged, bareheaded and scantily clad. A
bunch of jangling bells was tied to his girdle, and
his hands were full of what looked like small blue
hand-bills. DeKay got up quickly. "There's an
evening extra," he said. "It's the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kokumin Shimbun</i>."
He bolted down the steps, stopped the runner
and returned with one of the blue sheets.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He scanned it rapidly�he was a student of the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page273" id="page273" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
vernacular. "Nothing especial," he informed them.
"Prices in Wall Street are smashing the records.
That looks like a clear political horizon, in spite
of what the wiseacres have been saying. This visit
of the Squadron will prove a useful poultice, no
doubt, to reduce international inflammation�its
officers being shown the sights of the capital, and
the celebrations to come off as per schedule, including
the Naval Minister's ball to-morrow night.
By the way," he added, turning to Ware, "I arranged
for an invitation for you. It's probably at
the hotel in Tokyo now, awaiting your arrival."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A little gleam came to Ware's eyes. The threads
were in his hands, and this suited his plan.
"Thanks," he said; "you're very kind, Commander.
I shall see the subject of your rhapsody, then, before
the Judge puts on his black cap."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah, but you'll have no chance," laughed the
Baroness. "Trust a woman's eye."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Unless his a�roplane takes a tumble," said the
American girl reflectively. "There's always a
chance for a tragedy there!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They rose to depart. "We are actually going to
the opera, Mr. Ware," said the Baroness; "the
'Popular Hardman Comic Opera Company,' if you
please, 'with Miss Cissy Clifford.' Doesn't that
sound like Broadway? It comes over every season
from Shanghai, and it's our regular spring dissipation.
You'd not be tempted to join us, I suppose?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page274" id="page274" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
He bowed over her hand. "It is my misfortune
to have an engagement here."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, then�<i style="text-shadow: none;">jusqu'au bal</i>. Good night."</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware drank his black coffee alone on the terrace.
Daunt�a Secretary of Embassy! A rival less experienced
than he, full of youth's enthusiasms�a
young Romeo, wooing from the garden of officialdom!
It had been a handful of days against his
own round year; a few meetings, at most, to offset
his long and constant plan! And, as a result, the
thing he had seen through the car window. He
shut his teeth. He would have taken bitter toll of
that kiss!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he lit his cigar, one of the hotel boys came to
him. On his arrival Ware had sent him to Phil's
bungalow on the Bluff with a note.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ware-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i> not at home," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Where is he?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No Yokohama now. He go Tokyo yesterday.
Stay one week."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Is he at the hotel there?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Boy say no hotel. House have got."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What is the address?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Boy no must tell. He say letter send Tokyo
Club."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware's composure had been fiercely shaken that
night and this obstacle in his path pricked him to the
point of exasperation. With impatience he threw
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page275" id="page275" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
away his cigar and walked out through the cool,
brilliant evening.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the glittering pageant of the prismatic streets
inspired only a rising irritation. When a pedestrian
jostled him, the elaborate bow of apology
and ceremonial drawing-in of breath met with only
a morose stare. He left the Bund and threaded the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">Honcho-dori</i>�the "Main Street"�striving to curb
his mood. Midway of its length was a jeweler's
shop-window with a beautiful display of jewel-jade.
In it was hung a sign which he read with a wry
smile: "English Spoken: American Understood."
Ware entered and handed the Japanese clerk his
broken cigar-case.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The counter was spread with irregular pieces of
the green and pink stone, wrought with all the laborious
cunning of the oriental lapidary. At his
elbow a clerk was packing a jade bracelet into a
tiny box for delivery. He wrapped and addressed
it painstakingly with a little brush�</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">Esquire Philp Weare,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">

</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the street Ware smiled grimly as he entered the
address in his note-book. He had always believed
in his luck. To-morrow he would find Phil, and
gain further enlightenment�incidentally on the
matter of jade bracelets! His mouth set in contemptuous
lines as he walked back to the hotel.</p>

that is all you know?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That is all, Ishida-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i>," Haru answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They stood in the cryptomeria shadows of Reinanzaka
Hill, from which he had stepped to her side
as she came from the Embassy gate. It was dark,
for the moon was not yet risen, and the evening was
very still. One sleepy <i style="text-shadow: none;">semi</i> bubbled in the foliage
and in the narrow street at the foot of the hill, with
its glimmering <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>, she could hear the fairy tinkle
of wind bells in the eaves.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Such an ambush by her lover, unjustified, would
have been a dire affront to the girl's rigid Japanese
code of decorum. That he had seen Phil greet her
at Mukojima the evening before had shamed her
pride, and in speaking of it to-night he had seemed
at first to lay a rude finger on her maiden dignity.
But she had seen in an instant that his errand was
inspired by neither anger nor jealousy. He had
touched at once her instinct of the momentous.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her quick, clever brain and finely attuned perception
read what lay beneath his questions. The great
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page277" id="page277" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
European expert whom Japan herself employed, and
the young foreigner who had pursued her�were
they, then, objects of question to that wonderful,
many-sided governmental machine which was lifting
Japan into the front rank of modern nations?
Although she had never shared the disfavor with
which her father viewed her lover's duties, she had
wondered at his present apparently menial position.
To-night she was gaining a quick glimpse beneath
the surface. He told her nothing of the details
which, though he could not himself have built a
tangible indictment from them, had one by one clung
together into a sharp suspicion that embraced the
two men. But the agitation she felt in his words
had sent a quick thrill through her, had tapped that
deep racial well of feeling, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Yamato Damashii</i>,
which is the Japanese birthright. She felt a sudden
passionate wish that she, though a woman,
might pour herself into the mighty stream of effort�though
she be but a whirling cherry-petal in the
great wind of her nation's destiny. He had come
to her for any shred of information that might add
to his knowledge of the youth who was now Bersonin's
satellite. But she had been able to tell him
nothing. She had often seen the huge expert�his
automobile had clanged past her that morning�but
till to-night she had not even known the other's
name or where he lived. "That is all, Ishida-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i>."
It hurt her to say these words.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page278" id="page278" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
She bowed to his ceremonious farewell, a slim,
misty figure that stood listening to his rapid footsteps
till they died in the darkness. She walked
up the dim slope with lagging pace. The steep road,
always deserted at night, had no sound of grating
cart or whirring <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i>, but her paper lantern was
unlighted and no song greeted the crow that flapped
his grating way above her head. She was thinking
deeply.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At the top of the hill, opposite the huge, rivet-studded
gate of the Princess' compound, lay the lane
on which the Chapel stood. An evening service was
in progress and the faint sound of the organ was
borne to her. As she turned into the darker shade
she was aware of two pedestrians coming toward
her,�of a voice which she recognized with a shiver
of apprehension. The sentry-box by the great gate
stood close at hand. It was empty, and she stepped
into it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Doctor Bersonin and Phil paused at the turning,
while the latter lit a cigar from a match which he
struck on the sentry-box. Haru's heart was in her
throat, but her dark <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> blent with the wood
and the flash that showed her both faces blinded
his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"See!" said the doctor. A mile away, from the
low-lying darkness of Hibiya Park, a stream of fireworks
shot to the zenith, to explode silently in clusters
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page279" id="page279" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
of colored balls. "The first rocket in honor of
the Squadron!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"To-morrow the Admiral has an Imperial audience,"
said Phil, "and the superior officers are to be
decorated."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So!" said the other in a low, malignant voice.
"And I�who have designed Japan's turrets and
cheapened her arsenal processes�I may not wear
the Cordon and Star of the Rising-Sun!" In the
darkness a smile of malice crossed his face. "We
shall see if she will hold her head so high�<i style="text-shadow: none;">then</i>!
Whether war follow or not, it will damn her in the
eyes of the nations! She will not recover her prestige
in twenty years!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They passed on down the dark slope, out of sight
and hearing of the girl crouched in a corner of the
sentry-box. At the foot of the hill, Bersonin said:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It will take some days longer to finish my work,
but the ships will stay for a fortnight. To-morrow
night I will mark the triangle on the roof of the
bungalow, so that the angle of the tripod will be
exact. There must be no bungling. You can go by
an earlier train, so we shall not be seen together, and
I shall return here in time for the ball."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a fire in Haru's bosom as she went on
along the thorn-hedges. She had heard every word,
and she said the English sentences over and over
to herself to fix them in her mind. What they
had been talking of was the secret that lay beneath
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page280" id="page280" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
Ishida's questions�for an instant she had almost
touched it. A feeling of deep pride rose in
her. Japan was not sleeping�it watched! And in
the path of the plotting danger stood her lover.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">These two men hated Japan! War? They had
used the word. Japan did not fear war! Had not
that been proven? Her heart swelled. But the
thing they were planning was her country's enduring
humiliation, "whether war follow or not!" She
felt a sudden deep horror. Could such plots be and
their God�<i style="text-shadow: none;">her</i> God now�not blast them with His
thunder? And one of these men had spoken with
her, touched her, <i style="text-shadow: none;">kissed</i> her! She struck herself repeatedly
and hard on the lips.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">All at once she shivered. Might it be that in
spite of all, such a black design could succeed?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Chapel was brilliantly lighted and the rose-window
threw beautiful tints, like shawls of many-colored
gauze, over the shrubbery. She entered and
slipped into a seat near the door, burning with her
thoughts. The first evening service had brought a
curious crowd and the place was nearly filled. She
rose for the singing and knelt for the prayer mechanically,
her delicate fingers twisting the little
white-enamel cross hanging from its thin gold chain
on the bosom of her <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>. Painful imaginings
were running through her mind. The lesson was
being read: it was from the Old Testament, the
modern, somewhat colloquial translation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page281" id="page281" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span></p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">This-after, Samson a Sorek Valley woman
called Delilah did love.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Then the Princes of the Philistines the woman-to
up-came, saying:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As for you, by sweet discourse prevail that
where his great power is or by what means
overcoming, to bind and torture him we may
be able ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It seemed to her suddenly that a great wind filled
all the Chapel and that the words sat on it. Slowly
her face whitened till it was the hue of death.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">She</i> might find out the secret!</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And Delilah to Samson said: where your
great power is or by what means overcoming
to bind and torture you one may be able, this
me tell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She began to tremble in every limb. She, a <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai's</i>
daughter? She thought of her father, aged
and broken, grieving that he had had no son in the
war. She had been but a useless girl-child, left to
plant paper prayers at the cross-roads for the brave
men who longed to achieve a glorious death. If she
did this thing�would it not be for Japan?</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And he at last-to his mind completely opened.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The woman's knees-upon Samson did sleep
and she called a man who of his head the seven
locks cut off ... and the power of him
was lost.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page282" id="page282" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
If she did, would it avail? She remembered Phil's
eyes on her face the day on the sands at Kamakura�their
smouldering, reckless glow. She remembered
the bamboo lane! In those daredevil kisses
her woman's instinct had divined the force of the
attraction she exercised over him�had felt it with
contempt and a self-humiliation that burned her like
an acid. To use that for her purpose? But she was
a Christian! From the Christian God's "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Thou shalt
not</i>" there was no appeal.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She remembered suddenly her last service at the
Buddhist temple across the lane, and how the old
priest had bade her a gentle farewell, wishing her
peace and joy in her new religion, and saying smilingly
that all religions were augustly good, since
they pointed the same way. She saw the nunnery,
with its tall clumps of yellow dahlias and wild
hydrangeas; above which hung gauzy robes that
waved like gray ghosts escaping from the mold into
the sunshine. She saw the cherry-trees touched by
the golden summer light, the mossy monuments in
the burying-ground, the pigeons fluttering about the
lichened pavement.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The audience was singing now�the Japanese version
of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Jesus, Lover of My Soul</i>:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">

She could no longer be a Christian!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the old gods of her people shining from their
golden altars�the ancient divinities who looked
for ever down above the sound of prayer�they
would smile upon her!</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page284" id="page284" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXIII" id="chXXXIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE FLIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">For</span> all save one, sleep came early that evening
to the house in the Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods.
In her little room Haru lay as stirless
as a sleeping flower. There was no sound save the
hushed accents of the outer night that penetrated
the wooden <i style="text-shadow: none;">amado</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At length she rose, noiselessly slid the paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>,
and with infinite care, inch by inch, pushed back the
shutters. The moon had risen and a flood of moonlight
came into the room. Stealthily she opened
a wall-closet and selected her best and gayest robe�a
holiday <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> of dim green, with lotos flowers,
and an <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i> of cloth-of-gold, with chrysanthemums
peeping from the weave. By the round mirror on
her low dressing-cabinet, she redressed the coiled
ebony butterfly of her hair, and set a red flower
in it. She touched her face with the soft rice-powder,
and added a tint of carmine to the set paleness
of her cheeks. She wrapped in a <i style="text-shadow: none;">furoshiki</i>
some soberer street clothing, toilet articles, and
a mauve <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> woven with silver camelias, set the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page285" id="page285" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
bundle by the opened <i style="text-shadow: none;">amado</i> and noiselessly passed
into the next room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was the larger living-apartment. The tiny lamp
which burned before the golden shrine of Kwan-on
on the Buddha-shelf cast a wan glimmer over the
spotless alcove, and threw a ghostly light on her
finery. Through the thin paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i> she could
hear her father's deep breathing, and in the room in
which he slept a little clock chimed eleven. She
opened the door of the shrine and stood looking at
the tablet it held�the <i style="text-shadow: none;">ihai</i> of her mother. The
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kaimyo</i>, or soul name, it bore signified "Moon-Dawn-of-the-Mountain-of-Light-Dwelling-in-the-Mansion-of-Luminous-Perfume."
She rubbed her
palms softly together before it and her lips moved
silently. From the golden shadows she seemed
suddenly to feel her mother's hand guiding her
childish steps to that place of morning worship,
to see that loving face, as she remembered it, looking
down on her across the rim of years. She
bent and passed her hand along the two swords, one
long, one short, that rested on their lacquered rack
beneath the shelf�it was her farewell to her father.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had left no message. She could tell no one. If
she succeeded, she would have done her part. If she
failed�there was only a blank darkness in that
thought. But she had no agitation now�only a dull
ache.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In her own room she took a book from a drawer
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page286" id="page286" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
and slipped it into her sleeve, caught up the <i style="text-shadow: none;">furoshiki</i>,
stepped noiselessly to the outer porch and
carefully closed the <i style="text-shadow: none;">amado</i> behind her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She walked swiftly back to the empty Chapel.
The great glass window that had seemed so beautiful
with the light behind it, was now dark and
opaque and dead. Only the cross above the roof in
the moonlight looked as white as snow. She drew
the book from her sleeve. It was her Bible, with
her name on the fly-leaf. She unhooked the gold
chain about her neck and slipped off the little enamel
cross. She put this between the leaves of the Bible
and laid it on the doorstep.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A half-hour later she stood before a wistaria-roofed
gate in <i style="text-shadow: none;">Kasumiga-tani Cho</i>�the "Street-of-the-Misty-Valley"�near
Aoyama parade-ground.
The glass lantern above it threw a dim light on a
gravel path twisting through low shrubbery. Down
the street she could hear a dozen students chanting
the marching song of Hiros� Chusa, the young war
hero:</p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">"Though the body die, the spirit dies not.</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">He who wished to be reborn</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">Seven times into this world,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">For the sake of serving his country,</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">For the sake of requiting the Imperial Favor�</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;">Has he really died?"</span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Haru opened the gate. Cherry-petals were sifting
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page287" id="page287" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
down like rosy snowflakes over the scarlet trembling
of <i style="text-shadow: none;">nanten</i> bushes. A little way inside was a
graceful house entrance half-shaded by a trailing
vine. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">amado</i> were not closed, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> were
brilliantly lighted.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a little sob she unfastened the golden <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i>,
rewound and tied it with the knot in front.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page288" id="page288" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXIV" id="chXXXIV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">ON THE KNEES OF DELILAH</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> room where Phil sat was softly bright
with <i style="text-shadow: none;">andon</i>, through whose thin paper sides
the candle-light filtered tranquilly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It had been furnished in a plain, half-foreign
fashion; a book-rack and a French mahogany desk
sat in a corner, an ormolu clock ticked on its top,
and beside it was a lounge piled with volumes from
the shelves. On a bracket sat three small carvings
in dark wood, replicas of the famous monkeys of
the great Jingoro the Left-Handed, preserved in
Iyeyasu temple at Nikko. With their paws one covered
his eyes, another his ears, the third his mouth,
representing the "I see not�I hear not�I tell not"
of the ancient wisdom.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The place, however, to which these had given a
suggestion of quaint and extraordinary art, was now
touched with a certain tawdriness. It would have
affected a Japanese almost to nausea. The severity
of beauty of its etched and paneled walls, the plain
elegance of its satinwood fittings, were cheapened
with a veneer of vulgarity. A row of picture postcards
in colors was pinned on the wall�the sort
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page289" id="page289" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span>
the tourist buys for ten <i style="text-shadow: none;">sen</i> on the Ginza, too highly
tinted and with much meretricious gilding�and a
photograph hung in a silver-gilt frame of interlocked
dragons. It showed a girl in abbreviated skirts and
exaggerated posture; on the mount was printed:
"Miss Cissy Clifford in <i style="text-shadow: none;">Gay Paree</i>." The air was
full of the sickly-sweetish smell of Turkish cigarettes.
The desk was a confusion of pipes, ivory
<i style="text-shadow: none;">nets'ke</i>, cigarette-boxes and what not, and a man's
cloth cap and a gauntlet were tossed in a corner,
beside an open gold-lacquer box heaped with gloves.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil, however, felt no qualm. The room fitted
him as a scabbard fits its sword. He had discarded
his heavier outer clothing and donned a loose, wide-sleeved
robe of cool silk, tied with a crimson cord.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Give me the whisky-and-soda," he said to the
grizzled servant, in the vernacular, "and I shan't
want you again to-night."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bottle the Japanese left at his elbow was becoming
Phil's constant comforter. Alone with his
thoughts, he fled to it as the <i style="text-shadow: none;">hashish</i> eater to his
drug, because it banished his dread and bolstered the
courage that he longed for. To-night, as he sat
with the intoxication creeping like dull fire in his
blood, he was thinking of Haru, with her soft
smooth skin, her perfect neck, her lithe, graceful
limbs, her eyes that held caught laughter like moss
in amber.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His thought broke off. He had heard a sound
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page290" id="page290" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
outside. It seemed to be a light tapping on the grill
of the outer door. Could it be Bersonin? Had anything
gone wrong? He went hastily into the anteroom
and opened the grill.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For an instant he stared unbelievingly at the figure
standing there, the gay <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, the rouged
cheeks, the sparkling eyes. He took a step forward.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Haru! Is it really you, little girl?" he cried.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She laughed�a high, clear, flute-like note. "Such
an astonish!" she said. "You not know my <i style="text-shadow: none;">mus'</i>
come ... after ... after those kiss? Can I
not to come in, Phil-lip?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a laugh that echoed her own�but one of
ringing triumph�he caught her hand, drew her into
the lighted room and closed the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>. His look
flamed over her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I couldn't believe my eyes!" he cried. "I don't
half believe them yet! Why, your hands are as cold
as ice. We'll have a drink, eh!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He went into an outer room, came back with a
bottle of champagne and knocked off its neck
against the mantel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes, yes!" she said. "My mus' drink�so to be
gay, Phil-lip!" She drank the bubbling liquor at a
draft. "What are the use of to be good? <i style="text-shadow: none;">N�?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You're right, little girl! The pious people are
the dull ones!" He came to her unsteadily�he had
noticed the reversed <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i>. "So you'll train with me,
eh? Well, we'll show them a trick or two! How
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page291" id="page291" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
would you like to have plenty of money, Haru�as
much as you can count on a <i style="text-shadow: none;">soroban</i>? Would you
think a lot more of me if I got it for you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You so�much clever!" she laughed. "No all
same Japan man. He ve-ree stupid! My think you
mos' bes' clever man in these whole worl', to goin'
find so much money�<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�?</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a savage elation he drew her close in his
arms. The great spiral of her headdress drooped
under his caresses, and the blue-black hair fell all
about the white face.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page292" id="page292" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span></p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">WHEN A WOMAN DREAMS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Riding</span> with Patricia in the big victoria next
day, its red-striped runner diving ahead, Barbara
forgot her vague wonder at Haru's disappearance,
as she felt the enchanted mystery of
Tokyo creep further into her heart. They threaded
the softly dreaming silence of the willow-bordered
moat that clasps the Imperial grounds with a girdle
of cloudy emerald, where the "Dragon Pines" of the
great <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shogun Iyemits</i> fling their craggy masses of
olive-green down over the leaning walls to kiss the
mirroring water�past many-roofed, Tartar-like
watch-towers, cream-white on the blue, and through
little parks with forests of thin straight-boled trees
and placid lotos ponds seething with the dagger-blue
flashings of dragon-flies, all woven together into a
tapestry, lovely, remote, fantastic�like the projection
of some dream-legend whose people lived a
fairy story in a picture-book world.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On this oriental background continually appeared
quaint touches of the foreign and bizarre: a huge
American straw hat, much befrilled and befeathered,
on the head of a baby strapped to its mother's
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page293" id="page293" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
back, or a hideous boa of chenille like bunched caterpillars
marring the delicate native neckwear of an
exquisite <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the slope of a hill they came on a motley
crowd, which included a sprinkling of foreigners,
gathered before the entrance of a temple yard,
where a rough, improvised amphitheater had been
erected. Patricia called to the driver, and he
pulled up.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Fire-walk," said the <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i>. "Ontak� temple."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">From their elevated seat they could see white-robed
and barefooted priests waving long-handled
fans and wands topped with shaggy paper tassels
over an area of red-hot cinders. Presently some of
them strode calmly across the smoking mass.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"They call that the 'Miracle of Kudan Hill,'" said
Patricia. "They are making incantations to the god
of water to come and drive out the god of fire. It's
a <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shinto</i> rite."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A laugh rose from the spectators. The High
Priest was inviting the foreigners to attempt the
ordeal.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Look!" said Patricia. "There is the man who
got the free lecture out of your uncle on the train�the
man with the white waistcoat and the red beard.
And there's 'Martha,' too. I do believe she's going
to try it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was. Undeterred by the misgivings of the
rest, the lady of the painted muslin calmly divested
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page294" id="page294" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
herself of shoes and stockings and marched across
and back again. "There!" she said triumphantly.
"I said I would, and I <i style="text-shadow: none;">did</i>! It may be a miracle,
but my feet are simply <i style="text-shadow: none;">frying</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The carriage rolled on across a section of busy
trade. From a side street came the brassy blare of
a phonograph.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What a baffling combination it is!" said Barbara.
"Last night some of those people were at Mukojima,
listening to dead little drums and squealing
fifes, and to-night here is Damrosch and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Intermezzo</i>."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The other day when I passed," said Patricia, "it
was <i style="text-shadow: none;">Waltz Me Around Again, Willie</i>, and forty
children were prancing to it. Martha's husband is
'in' phonographs, by the way. She told me all about
it at the Review. He's making a set of Japanese records�<i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>
songs and native orchestra pieces and
even street-noises�to copyright at home."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Presently the horses stopped before a great gate
of unpainted cedar, roofed with black and white
tiles and bossed with nails of hammered copper.
Above it two pine-trees writhed like a Dor� print.
"One of the Empress' ladies-in-waiting lives here,"
Patricia said. "I'll walk home and on the way I can
leave some 'call-tickets'�Tucker's name for visiting-cards.
Give my love to the bishop."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked wistfully after Barbara as the latter
bowled away toward Ts'kiji and her uncle's. Under
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page295" id="page295" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
her flyaway spirits Patricia had the warmest little
heart in the world, loyal to its last beat to those she
liked. Daunt was decidedly in this category. Like
the rest, she had been weaving a cheerful little romance
for these two friends. Since the evening at
the Cherry-Moon, however, when the newly arrived
yacht had been talked of, she had had misgivings.
Yesterday, too, Barbara, while confiding nothing,
had told her of Austen Ware's coming. Patricia
walked up the driveway slowly and with a puzzled
frown.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the girl driving on under cherry-stained sky
and cherry-scented winds, knew, that one hour, no
problems. She was full of the flame and pulse of
youth, of a new nascent tenderness and a warm
sense of loving all the world. She asked herself if
she could really be the poised, self-contained girl
who a few weeks ago sailed for the Orient. Some
magic alchemy had transmuted all her elements.
New emotions dominated her, and through the
beauty before her gaze went flashing more beautiful
thoughts that linked with the future.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In her pocket was a letter. It had been brought
to her that morning when she woke and she had
read it over and over, kneeling in the drift of pillows,
her red-gold hair draping her white shoulders,
thrilling, murmuring little inarticulate answers to its
phrases, looking up now and then to peer through
the bamboo <i style="text-shadow: none;">sudar�</i> to the white and green cottage
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page296" id="page296" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
across the lawn. He would not see her to-day�until
evening. Then he would ask her....</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As the carriage bore her on, she whispered again
and again one of the sentences he had written:
"There has never been another woman to me, Barbara.
There never will be! My Lady of the Many-Colored
Fires!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page297" id="page297" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXVI" id="chXXXVI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">BEHIND THE SHIKIRI</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Mr. Y. Nakajima</span>, the almond-eyed
guide of gold-filled teeth, came to the end
of his elaborate conversation. He turned
from the old servant, leaning on his pruning knife,
and spoke to the man who stood waiting outside the
wistaria-gate in the Street-of-the-Misty-Valley.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He say Mr. Philip Ware stay here," he announced,
"but house is ownerships of his friend, Mr.
Daunt, of America Embassy. He regret sadly that
no one are not at home."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware reflected. Daunt's house? He lived in the
Embassy compound�so they had said at dinner last
night. Why should he maintain this native house
in another quarter of Tokyo? There came to his
mind that hackneyed phrase "the custom of the
country," the foreigner's specious justification of the
modern "Madame Butterfly." In this interminable
city, with its labyrinthine mazes, who could tell
what this or that gray roof might shelter? Was this
a nook enisled, for pretty Japanese romances "under
the rose"? He had loaned it to Phil�they were
friends.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page298" id="page298" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
Ware struck his stick hard against the hedge. He
scarcely knew what thought had entered his mind,
so nebulous was it, so indefinable. If he had thought
to use this discovery, he knew no way; if it was
Daunt's covert, here was Phil in possession.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ask him if he has any idea where he is."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The guide translated. The servant was ignobly
unacquainted, as yet, with the <i style="text-shadow: none;">danna-San's</i> illustrious
habits. He arrogantly presumed to suggest that
he might augustly be in any one of a hundred
esteemed spots.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware thought a moment, frowningly. "Tell him
I am Ware-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San's</i> brother," he said then, "and that
I have just arrived in Tokyo. I shall wait in the
house till he comes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The old man bowed profoundly at the statement
of the relationship. He spoke at some length to the
guide. The latter looked at Ware questioningly but
hesitated.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well?" asked the other tartly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He think better please you wait to the hotel."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware struck open the gate with a flare of irritation.
"You can go now," he said to the guide, and
disdaining the servant, strode along the gravel path
to the house entrance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The old man looked after him with an enigmatic
Japanese smile. It was not his fault if the foreigners
(the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kappa</i> devour them!) ate dead beasts and
were all quite mad! He tucked up his <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page299" id="page299" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
stacked his gardening-tools neatly under the hedge,
and betook himself across the street for a smoke and
a game of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Go</i> with the neighbor's <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Under the trailing vine Ware slid back the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>
and entered the house.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he stood looking at the interior his lip curled.
He hated the cheapness and vulgarity to which Phil
turned with instinctive liking, and he had long ago
come thoroughly to despise his younger brother and
to relish the whip-hand which the law, with its
guardianship, gave him. The place fitted Phil, from
the cigarette odor to the loud photograph in the
dragon-frame and the partly open wall-closet with
its significant array of bottles. It expressed his idea
of "a good time!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He slid open a <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i>. It showed a room, evidently
unused, littered with tools, a dusty table with
models of curious wing-like propellers, a small electric
dynamo and a steel-lathe. He opened another,
and stood looking at the room it disclosed with a
faint smile. It was scrupulously clean and orderly,
and, in contrast to the outer apartment, had an
atmosphere of delicate refinement. On the wall
hung a tiny gilt image of Kwan-on and below it on
an improvised shelf an incense rod was burning
with a clean, pungent odor. At one side was suspended
a mosquito-bar of dark green gauze, and
across a low stool was laid a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, with silver
camelias on a mauve ground. He picked this up
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page300" id="page300" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
and looked at it curiously, half conscious of a faint
perfume that clung to it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He shut his teeth. The camelia had always been
Barbara's favorite flower!</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Meanwhile the girl thus incongruously in his
thought had felt a gray shadow across her sunshine.
She found her uncle greatly perplexed and troubled.
Haru's Bible, found on the Chapel doorstep, had
been brought to him that morning. He had sent at
once to the Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods and the
messenger had returned with news of her disappearance.
The fact that she had taken clothing with her
showed that the flight was a deliberate one.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It pained him to think what the return of the
book and the little cross might mean. In his long
residence in Japan the bishop had grown accustomed
to strange <i style="text-shadow: none;">d�nouements</i>, to flashing revelations
of subtle deeps in oriental character. But save
for one instance of many years ago�which the sight
of Barbara must always recall to him�he had never
been more saddened than by to-day's disclosure.
What he told her had left Barbara with an uneasy
apprehension. She drove away pondering. The
anxious speculation blurred the glamour of the
afternoon.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The homeward course took her through Aoyama,
by unfrequented streets of pleasant, suburban-like
gardens and small houses with roofs of fluted tile
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page301" id="page301" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
as softly gray as silk. Here and there a bean-curd
peddler droned his cry of "<i style="text-shadow: none;">To-o-fu! To-o-fu-u!</i>"
and under a spreading <i style="text-shadow: none;">kiri</i> tree a blind beggar
squatted, playing a flute through his nostrils, while
his wife, also blind and with a beady-eyed baby
strapped to her back, twanged a <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> beside him.
In the road groups of little girls were playing
games with much clapping of hands and shouting in
shrill voices.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In one of the cross-streets a dozen coolies strode,
carrying flaming white banners painted in red idiographs.
The last bore a huge <i style="text-shadow: none;">papier-mach�</i> bottle�an
advertisement of a popular brand of beer. A
brass band of four pieces, discoursing hideously
tuneless sounds, led them, and between band and
banners stalked a grotesquely clad figure on stilts
ten feet tall, the shafts pantalooned so that his legs
seemed to have been drawn out like India-rubber.
The spidery pedestrian was followed by a score of
staring children of all ages and sizes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly Barbara rose to her feet in the carriage.
She had seen a girl emerge from a small temple and
turn into a side street.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Fast! Drive fast, Taka," she called quickly.
"The street to the left!" He obeyed, but a <i style="text-shadow: none;">soba-ya</i>
had halted his shining copper cart of steaming buckwheat,
and momentarily delayed them.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The hastening figure was farther away when they
rounded the turning. Barbara clasped her hands together.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page302" id="page302" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
"It <i style="text-shadow: none;">was</i> Haru! It <i style="text-shadow: none;">was</i> Haru! I am <i style="text-shadow: none;">sure</i>!"
she whispered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The girl slipped through a gateway hung with
wistaria. As Barbara sprang to the ground she was
hurrying through the garden.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Haru!" But the flying figure did not seem to
hear the call.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara ran quickly after her along the gravel
path.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the house, Austen Ware, standing with the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> in his hand, had heard the rumble of carriage
wheels. He had left the outer <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> open, and
through the aperture he saw the slim form hastening
toward the doorway. An exclamation broke from
his lips. Behind her, just entering the gate, was
Barbara!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a breath he stared. A cool, thriving suspicion�one
bred of his anger and humiliation, that
shamed his manhood�ran through him. Barbara,
<i style="text-shadow: none;">there</i>? Was it another <i style="text-shadow: none;">rendezvous</i>, then? The
fierce, self-dishonoring doubt merged into the mad
jealousy that already burned him like a brand.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He dropped the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, drew back the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i> of
the unused apartment, and stepped inside.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Swiftly and noiselessly the light partition slipped
into place behind him.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page303" id="page303" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXVII" id="chXXXVII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">&#12489;&#12531;&#12488;</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Through</span> the thin paper pane, parted by his
moistened finger, Ware's hot, hollow eyes saw
the Japanese girl come into the room. She
had not waited to shut the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> behind her. She
drew quick sobbing breaths and her eyes had the
desperate look of a hunted animal. She ran into the
sleeping apartment and closed its <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara had halted at the doorway. As she stood
looking in, her eyes fell on the mauve <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
with its silver camelias. It was the robe Haru had
worn the first evening she came to her. If she had
doubted, all doubt was now gone. An instant she
hesitated, then, with sudden resolution, knocked on
the grill and stepped across the threshold.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The man who watched could not solve the puzzle,
but in that instant the sick suspicion he had harbored
became a cold and lifeless thing in his breast.
A sense of shame rushed through him as he saw her
gaze wander about the interior with its veneer of the
foreign: to the disordered desk�the lounge and its
litter of books�the photograph on the wall�the
open panel with its champagne bottles. In her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page304" id="page304" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
glance distaste had grown to a quick question. The
coarse suggestions of the place were welling over
her. Whose house was this? Had Haru seen her
and was she hiding from her?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly she saw the man's cap and gauntlet in
the corner. Her cheeks rushed into flame. She
seemed to see Haru's innocent face smiling at her
over the throbbing <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> and through its tones to
hear again the echo of a ribald laugh before the
gilded cages of the Yoshiwara. Something in her
cried out against the inference. All at once she took
an abrupt step forward. She was looking at the
round glass lantern just outside the doorway, painted
with three characters:</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;">&#12489;&#12531;&#12488;</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She chilled as if ether had been poured in her
veins. The name they stood for had been her first
lesson in Japanese�<i style="text-shadow: none;">which Haru had taught her</i>!
She snatched up one of the volumes from the chair.
It was Lillienthal's <i style="text-shadow: none;">Conquest of the Air</i>. She
opened it to the title page.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware, watching, saw with surprise that she was
trembling violently. She had grown pale to the
lips. The book slipped from her fingers and crashed
on to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i>. It lay there, open as she had held
it, and he saw what was written across the white
leaf. It was Daunt's name.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page305" id="page305" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His thought leaped as if at the flick of a lash.
Daunt's book! What was she thinking? The piteous
pallor that swept her face like an icy wave answered
him. Why she was there�her interest in
this Japanese girl who fled from her�he could not
guess. But it was clear that she had not known the
house was Daunt's, and that with the knowledge, she
was face to face with what must seem a damning
complicity. Perhaps some hint of this retreat had
come to her�he knew how gossip feathered its
shafts!�some covert allusion, some laughing <i style="text-shadow: none;">oui-dire</i>,
to which her coming had now given such verity.
Phil was the <i style="text-shadow: none;">deus ex machina</i> of the situation.
His Japanese <i style="text-shadow: none;">amour</i> she was now laying at Daunt's
door! All this flashed through his mind in an instant.
He watched her intently.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Over Barbara was sweeping a hideous chaos of
mocking voices, bits of recollection barbed with
agony. The little house near Aoyama parade-ground�the
carriage had passed the great empty
plaza a few moments ago�that he had kept from
"sentiment"! The house she had asked him to
show her, when he had evaded the request. And
Haru! A feeling of physical anguish like that of
death came to her; a dull pain was in her temples
and the floor seemed to be rising up with her toward
the ceiling. Daunt? He whose lips had lain on
hers, whose letter was in her bosom�it burned her
flesh now like a live coal! "There has never been
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page306" id="page306" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
another woman to me, Barbara. There never will
be!" The words seemed to launch themselves from
the air, stinging like fiery javelins.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Behind the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i>, a weird, malevolent clamor
was shouting through Ware's brain. He stood
alone with his temptation. What had he to do with
Daunt, or with her belief in him? She had accepted
his own advances, beckoned him half around the
world�for what? To discard him for this man
whom she had known but a handful of days!
Chance had arranged this <i style="text-shadow: none;">mise en sc�ne</i>. Was he to
tell her the truth�and lose her? The key to the
situation was in his hand. He had only to keep
silence!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At that moment he felt crumble down in some
crude gulf within the fabric of his self-esteem�the
high-built structure of years. Something colder,
formless and malignant, came to sit on its riven
foundations. A savage elation grew in him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly a <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i> was flung aside. Haru stood
there, her face deathly pale, her hands wrenching
and tearing at her sleeves. She laughed, a high,
gasping, unnatural treble.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So-o-o, <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i>! You come make visiting�<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�</i>?
The shrill voice rang through the silent room.
"My new house now, an' mos' bes' master. No
more Christian! My bad�oh, ve-ree bad Japan
girl!" With another peal of laughter she pointed
to the knot of her <i style="text-shadow: none;">obi</i>. It was tied in front.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page307" id="page307" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
Barbara ran down the garden path as if pursued.
She stepped into the carriage blindly. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">Fox-Woman</i>!
Votary of the Fox-God, at whose candle-lighted
shrine she had refused tribute!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">This, then, was the end. It came to her like the
striking of a great bell. To-morrow the streets
would lie as vivid in the sunlight, the buglers would
march as blithely, the bent pines would wave, the
lotos-pads in the moat glisten, the gorgeous <i style="text-shadow: none;">geisha</i>
flash by: she alone would know that the sun had
died in the blue heaven!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Home, Taka," she said, and leaned back and
closed her eyes.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Behind her Haru's laughter had broken suddenly.
She rushed into the little sleeping-room and threw
herself on the <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i> before the tiny image of Kwan-on,
in a wild burst of sobbing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware opened the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i> softly, and with noiseless
step, passed out of the house.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page308" id="page308" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXVIII" id="chXXXVIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE LADY OF THE MANY-COLORED FIRES</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> spacious residence of the Minister of
Marine that night was a maze of light. All
social Tokyo would be at the ball in honor of
the Admiral and officers of the visiting Squadron.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was late when Daunt turned his steps thither
through the fragrant evening. The deciphering of
a voluminous telegram had kept him at the Chancery
till eleven.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">All that day he had worked with a delicious exhilaration
rioting in his pulses. He had not seen Barbara,
but her face had seemed always before him�quiveringly
passionate as he had seen it in Ben-ten's
cave, hazed with daring softness as it had turned to
his on the steps of the railway carriage. There had
been moments when some aroma of the spring air
made him catch his breath, mindful of the crisp,
sweet scent of her hair or the maddening fragrance
of her lips. He thought of "Big" Murray and his
letter, at which he had bridled�how long ago?
He understood now what the complacent old pirate
had been talking about! He would have an epistle
to write him to-morrow in return! To-night he
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page309" id="page309" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
was to see her! In fancy he could feel her slim
hand on his sleeve as they danced�could see himself
sitting with her in some dusky alcove sweet
with plum-blossoms�could hear her say ...</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A hoarse warning from a <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i> and he sprang
aside for a carriage that dashed past through the
gateway. He shook himself with a laugh and walked
on through the shrubbery. By day it was a place of
mossy shadows, of shrubberied red-lacquer bridges
and glimmering cascades; now its polished dwarf-pines
and twisted cypresses gleamed with red paper
lanterns that hung like goblin fruit and quivered,
monster misshapen gold-fish, in the miniature lake.
Along the drives stood policemen, wearing white
trousers and gloves. Each held a paper lantern
painted with the Minister's <i style="text-shadow: none;">mon</i> or family crest.
Farther on carriages became thicker, till the approach
was a crawling stream of gleaming black
enamel, sweating horses, crackling whips, and
shouting <i style="text-shadow: none;">bettos</i>. Daunt picked his way among these
to where a wide swath of electric light beneath the
porte-coch�re struck into high relief a strip of scarlet
carpet.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The interior was dressed with that marvelous
attention to minuti� and artistic <i style="text-shadow: none;">ensemble</i> that is
characteristically Japanese. The great hall was
brilliant <i style="text-shadow: none;">opera bouffe</i>: a mingling crowd of gold-braided
uniforms crossed by colored cordons and
flashing with decorations, white necks and shoulders
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page310" id="page310" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
rising from dainty French gowns, gleaming lights,
Japanese men in European costume, languorous
black eyes under shining Japanese head-dresses, and
silken <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> woven in tints as soft as dreams. In
the large central room opposite was hung a painting
of the Emperor. Japanese who passed it did so
reverently. They did not turn their backs. Some
of the older ones bowed low before it and withdrew
backward. Through a doorway came glimpses of
couples on a polished floor swaying to music that
swelled and ebbed unceasingly, and down a long
vista a pink dazzle of cherry-blooms under a cloth
roof. Over all was the exotic perfume of flowers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt had seen many such affairs where the
blending of colors and sounds, the scintillant shifting
of forms, had been but a maze. To-night's,
however, was wound in a glory. All these decorative
people, this scented echo of laughter and music,
existed only to form a kaleidoscopic setting for the
one woman. He went to search for her with his
handsome head erect, his shoulders square and a
color in his face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He passed through several rooms, revealing one
oriental picture after another. In one a series of
glass-cases reproduced a <i style="text-shadow: none;">daimyo's</i> procession in Old
Japan: hundreds of dolls, six inches high, fashioned
in elaborate detail�coolies with banners; chest-bearers;
caparisoned horses; bullock-carts with
huge, black lacquer wheels; <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i>, visored and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page311" id="page311" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span>
clad in armor, with glittering swords and lances. In
another were cabinets spread with pieces of priceless
gold-lacquer that had cost a lifetime of loving
labor. A third the host denominated his "ghost-room,"
since it was lined with quaint pottery unearthed
in ancient Korean tombs. These rooms
were filled with the social world of the capital, a
gay glimmer of urbanity set off against masses of
all the blossoms of spring. In the last room the host
stood with the visiting Admiral and several Ambassadors.
He was a perfect type of the modern Japanese
of affairs, a diplomatist as well as a seasoned
Admiral. He had been at Annapolis in '75 and his
wife was a graduate of Wellesley. He was one of
the strongest of the powerful coterie which was
shaping the destinies of new Japan. Daunt greeted
him and paused to chat a while with his own chief
and Mrs. Dandridge. Her gown was gray and
silver, with soft old lace that accentuated the youthful
contour of her face, and framed the graciousness
and charm that made her marked in however charming
and gracious an assembly. Barbara was not
there.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He entered a veranda where people sat at little
tables eating ices frozen in the shape of Fuji, under
fairy lamps whose tiny bamboo and paper shades
were delicately painted with sworls of water and
swimming carp. From one group the Baroness
Stroloff waved a hand to him, but Barbara was not
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page312" id="page312" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
there. Beyond, through a canopied doorway, hung
the cherry-blooms. He paused on the threshold. It
was a portion of the garden walled in with white
cloth, and roofed with blue and gold. The space
thus inclosed was set with cherry-trees from whose
every gray twig depended the great pink pendants.
It was floored with soft carpeting, in the center a
fountain tinkled coolly, and the roof was dotted with
incandescents. In this retreat the violins of the ball-room
wove dreamily with the talk and laughter,
tenuous and ghost-like, soft as the music of memory.
She was not there. Daunt turned back, threaded the
hall and entered the ball-room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There, through the shifting crowd, over flashing
uniforms and diamonded tiaras, he saw her. Beside
her stood a little countess, one of the noted court
beauties, lotos-pale, bamboo-slender, in a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>
of Danjiro blue, with woven lilies. In the clear radiance,
Barbara stood almost surrounded. Her
white satin gown shimmered in the light, which
caught like globes of fire in the gold passion-flowers
with which it was embroidered. A new sense of her
beauty poured over him. She had always seemed
lovely, but now her loveliness was touched with
something removed and spiritual. In the blaze of
light she looked as delicately pale as a moon-dahlia,
but a spot of color was on either cheek and her eyes
were very bright. Daunt stood still, feasting his
gaze.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page313" id="page313" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
The Baroness Stroloff paused beside him, chatting
with the Cabinet Minister and the representative
of the Associated Press. They watched the
forms flit past in the swinging rhythm of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">deux-temps</i>,
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> weaving with black coats and uniforms,
varnished pumps gliding with milk-white
<i style="text-shadow: none;">tabi</i> and velvet pattens. "Pretty tinted creatures,"
she said. "How do they ever keep on those little
thonged sandals?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Ah, their toes were born to them," the journalist
answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The statesman shrugged his shoulders. "Waltzing
in <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> with men is very, very modern for
our Japanese ladies," he said. "I myself never saw
it until two years ago�when the American Fleet
was here. That established it as a fashion. Some
of us older ones may frown, but�<i style="text-shadow: none;">shikata-ga-nai!</i>
'Way out there is none,' as we say in our language.
It's a part of the process of Westernization!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt started when Patricia's fan tapped his arm.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You're frightfully late," she said, as her partner,
the German <i style="text-shadow: none;">Charg�</i>, bowed himself away. "Father
will give you a wigging if you don't look out."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I saw him a few moments ago," he answered.
"He didn't seem very fierce."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Was he still looking at those spooky curios? I
can't see what anybody wants such things for! I
always feel like saying what Mark Twain's man said
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page314" id="page314" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
when they showed him the mummy: 'If you've got
any nice fresh corpse, trot him out.'"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt's smile was a mechanism. She knew that
he had ceased to listen. As she looked at his side-face
with her clear, kind eyes, a shadow came to
her own. Her loyal heart was troubled. After
her drive that afternoon, Barbara had kept her room
on the plea of rest for the evening; she had not
come down to dinner and had appeared only at the
moment of starting. At the first glance, then, Patricia
had noticed the change. The Barbara she had always
known, of flashing impulses and girlish graces, was
gone; the Barbara of the evening had seemed suddenly
older, of even rarer beauty, perhaps, but with
something of detachment, of unfamiliarity. Riding
beside her to the ball, Patricia had felt, under the
eager, brilliant gaiety, this chilly sense of estrangement,
and it had puzzled her. Later she had come
to connect it with the man of whose coming Barbara
had told her, the man with handsome, bearded
face who had seemed, since his greeting in the moment
of their entrance, to take unobtrusive yet assured
possession of such of her moments as were not
given to the great. Withal, he had lent this an air of
the natural and habitual which, nicely poised and
completely conventional as it was, seemed to convey
a subtle atmosphere of proprietorship. So now, as
she saw Daunt's gaze, Patricia was a little sad.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page315" id="page315" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
There had fallen a silence between them which he
broke with a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No wonder!" he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No wonder what?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That she is a success."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Success! I should think so. She's danced with
three Ambassadors and Prince Hojo sat out two
numbers with her. Just look at the men around her
now!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The music had drifted into a waltz and the group
about Barbara was dissolving. A dark face was
bending near. Its owner put his arm about her
and they glided into the throng. Ware, like all
heavy men, danced perfectly and the pair seemed to
skim the mirroring floor as easily as swallows, her
red-bronze hair, caught under a web of seed-pearls,
glowing like a net of fire-flies. Heads turned back
over white shoulders and on the edges of the room
people whispered as they passed. Floating lightly
as sea-foam, the shimmering gown drew near, passing
so close that Daunt could have touched it. The
lovely white face, over her partner's shoulder, met
Daunt's. For a fraction of a second Barbara's eyes
looked into his�then swept by as if he had been
empty air. It was as if a clenched hand had struck
him across the face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He whitened. Patricia felt a sudden sting in her
eyelids. She slipped her hand through his arm, and
saying something about the heat (it was deliciously
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page316" id="page316" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
cool), drew him down the corridor. She chatted
on airily, fighting a desire to cry. But when they
came to the entrance of the cherry-blooms, he had
not spoken a word.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I see mother still in the spook room," she said.
"I must go back to her�no, please don't come with
me! Thank you so much for bringing me so far."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She left him with a nod and a bright smile that
he did not see. He was in a painful quicksand of
bewilderment. The cherry-garden was almost empty
and the fountain tinkled in a perfumed quiet. He
sat down on a bench in its farthest corner. What
did it mean? Why, it had been like the cut direct!
From her?�impossible! She had not seen him!
He had been mistaken! He would go to her�now!
He sprang up.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A page came into the garden. He was a part of
the Minister's establishment; Daunt had often seen
him in that house. He carried a tray with a letter
on it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"For you, sir," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Puzzled, Daunt took it and the boy withdrew. It
bore no address. He tore it open. It contained
some folded sheets of paper. A tense whiteness
sprang to his face as he unfolded them. It was his
letter�the only love-letter he had ever written�torn
across.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Now he knew! It had been true�what he had
imagined of the yacht! The cherry-trees seemed to
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page317" id="page317" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
writhe about him, bizarre one-legged dancers waving
pink draperies, and a tide of resentment and
grief rose in his breast as hot as lava. Had she
been only playing with him, then? When she had
lain panting in his arms in Ben-ten's cave�when her
lips had quivered to his kisses�had it all been acting?
Was this what she really was, his "Lady of
the Many-Colored Fires?" He, poor fool! had
deemed it real, when it had been only a week's
amusement. He had almost guessed the truth that
night at the tea-house, and how cleverly she had
fooled him! His jarring laugh rang out across the
tinkle of the fountain. Then, Austen Ware's telegram!
It was he who had danced with her to-night,
no doubt�Phil's brother. For her the little play
was over. The curtain had to be rung down, and
this was how she did it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Dim thoughts like these went flitting through the
gap of his racked senses. He dropped on the
bench and bowed his head between his hands. It
had been real enough to him. Painted on his closed
eyelids he seemed to see, with a chill, numb certainty,
his future unrolling like a gray panorama, incoherent
and unwhole, its colors lack-luster, its purpose
denied, its meaning missed. Pain lifted its snake-head
from the shadows and hissed in his ear, like
the jubilant serpent that coiled its bright length by
the gate of Eden when the flaming sword drove
forth the first man to the desert of despair.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page318" id="page318" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
Daunt did not know that Patricia, pausing in the
corridor, had seen the letter delivered and opened.
She went back to her mother with a slow step.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You look worn, dear," said Mrs. Dandridge, as
they entered the ball-room. "Are you tired?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," she said. "I think I won't dance any
more, mother."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The host had entered before them and now stood
at the end of the room with the Admiral of the
Squadron and the Ambassador of the latter's nation.
Suddenly a young man pushed hastily through the
press. He handed his chief a telegram. The Ambassador
scanned it, changed color, and held it out
to the Admiral with shaking hand. The Secretary
who had brought it said something to the Foreign
Minister, who turned instantly to give a quick order
to a servant. The orchestra stopped with a crash.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a dead hush over the brilliant room-full,
broken only by the movement of the Squadron's
officers as they came hurriedly forward beside
their Admiral. All looked at the white-haired diplomatist
who stood, his eyes full of tears, the pink
telegram in his hand.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He addressed the grave group of naval men.
"Gentlemen," he said, in a low voice, "I have the
great grief to announce the sudden death to-day of
His Majesty, the King."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He bowed to his host, and, followed by the Admiral
and his officers, left the house. The Ambassadors
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page319" id="page319" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
and Ministers of the other powers, in order
of their precedence, each with his glittering staff
and their ladies about him, followed. The gaiety
was over; it had ceased at the far-away echo of a
nation's bells, tolling half a world away.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The great house was almost emptied of its guests
when the solitary figure that had sat in the cherry-garden
passed out along the deserted corridors.
Daunt went utterly oblivious that its bright pageantry
had departed. A feverish color was in his cheek
and his eyes were dulled with a painful apathy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Count Voynich was lighting a cigarette in the
cloak room as he entered. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Sic transit!</i>" he said.
"This calls a quick halt on the plans of the Squadron's
entertainment, doesn't it!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was no answer. Daunt was fumbling, from
habit, for the lettered disk of wood in his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"If the King could have lived a few weeks
longer," said Voynich, "we'd have heard no more
talk of trouble with Japan. He was a great peacemaker.
The new regent may be less circumspect.
What do you think?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">No reply. He spoke again sharply.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I say, Miss Fairfax seems to be making a tremendous
walkover, eh?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was only silence. Daunt did not hear him.
Voynich looked at his face, whistled softly under
his breath, and went quietly away.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page320" id="page320" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXXXIX" id="chXXXIX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XXXIX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE HEART OF BARBARA</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> Ambassador, standing by the mantel,
looked thoughtfully at his wife. She sat in
a big wicker chair, in a soft dressing-gown,
her hands clasped over one knee in a pose very
pretty and girlish.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Come!" he said good-humoredly. "You women
are always imagining romances and broken hearts.
Why, Barbara and Daunt haven't known each other
long enough to fall in love."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She looked at him quizzically. "Do you remember
how long we had known each other when
you�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pshaw!" he retorted. "That's just like a woman.
She never can argue without coming to personalities.
Besides, there never was another girl like you,
my dear�I couldn't afford to take any chances."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Away with your blarney, Ned! You know I'm
right, though you won't admit it."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Of course I won't. Daunt's not a woman's man.
He never was. He's been getting along pretty well
with Barbara, no doubt. But this man she's going
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page321" id="page321" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
to marry she's known for a year. The bishop told
me about him the day after they landed. He thought
she was practically engaged to him then."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"'Practically!'" she commented with gentle
scorn. "Are girls who have been properly brought
up ever 'practically' engaged, and not fully so? She
may have expected to marry him, and yet if I ever
saw a girl in love�and, oh, Ned, remember that
I understand what that means!�she was in love
with Daunt yesterday. We women see more than
men and feel more. Patsy saw it too. She's feeling
badly about it, poor child, I think."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Nonsense!" the ambassador sniffed. "There
isn't a shred of evidence. Barbara's not a flirt in
the first place, and, if she were, Daunt can take care
of himself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He came to your study, didn't he, after the ball?
I thought I heard his voice in the hall."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," he answered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How did he look?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well," he said hesitatingly, "he was a bit off
color, I thought. I told him to take a few days off
and run up to Chuzenji."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Is he going?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. He's leaving early in the morning. But
don't get it into your sympathetic little head that it
has the slightest thing to do with Barbara. The
idea's quite absurd. He's never thought of such a
thing as falling in love with her!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page322" id="page322" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
"Don't you think a woman <i style="text-shadow: none;">knows</i> about these
things?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"When she's told. And Barbara has told you,
hasn't she?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"That she is going to marry Mr. Ware. Yes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, what more do you want?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She shook her head. "Only for her to be happy!"
she said tremulously. "I've never known a girl
who has grown so into my heart, Ned. I feel almost
as though she were Patsy's sister. She has no
mother of her own�no one to advise her. And yet�I�somehow
I couldn't talk about it to her. I
<i style="text-shadow: none;">tried</i>. She doesn't want to. It seemed almost as if
she were afraid."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Afraid?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Of doing something else. As if she were going
into this marriage as a refuge. I don't know just
why I felt that, but I did. She was so very pale, so
very quiet and contained. It didn't seem quite natural.
It made me think of Pamela Langham. You
remember her? She was in love with a man who�well,
whom she found she couldn't marry. He
wasn't the right sort. I suppose she was afraid she
would marry him anyway if she waited. So she
married another man at once�a man who had been
in love with her for years. We were just the same
age and she told me all about it at the time. To-night
when Barbara told me she had promised to
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page323" id="page323" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
marry this Mr. Ware�and soon, Ned!�I seemed
to see poor little dead Pamela looking at me with her
pale face and big, deep eyes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned her head and furtively wiped her eyes.
"If I could only be sure!" she said. "But I think
how I should feel�if it were Patsy, Ned!"</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And while they talked, Barbara lay in her blue-and-white
room, wide-eyed in the dark. The smiling,
ball-room mask had slipped from her face and
left it strained and white. She had drawn the curtain
and shut out the misty glory of the garden�and
the small white cottage across the scented lawn.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In those few agonized hours of the afternoon,
while she had lain there thrilling with suffering,
something deep within her had seemed to fail�as
though a newly-lighted flame, white and pure, had
fallen and died. Where it had gleamed remained
only a painful twilight. It had been a different Barbara
that had emerged. The fairest fabric of those
Japanese days had crashed into the dust, and in the
echo of its fall she stood anchorless, in terror of herself
and of the future. The harbor of convention
alone seemed to offer safety�and at the harbor entrance
waited Austen Ware. At the ball the die had
been cast.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Outside the window she could hear the rasp of the
pine-branches and the sleepy "korup! korup!" of a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page324" id="page324" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
pigeon. A tiny night-lamp was on the stand beside
her. Its gleam lit vaguely the golden Buddha on
the Sendai chest. Its face now seemed cold and
blank and cruel, and in its dim light, on the shadowy
wall, sharp detached pictures etched themselves. She
saw herself looking at Austen Ware's yacht, set in
that wonderful, warm, orient bay�a swift, white
monitor, watching her! She saw a yellow rank of
convicts filing into the yawning mouth of Shimbashi
Station�like the long, drab years of savorless
lives! She saw the great white plaster figure
over the entrance-arch of the Yoshiwara�beckoning
to hollow smiles that covered empty hearts!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Over the thronging pictures grew another�a
misty, nightgowned little figure who stood by her,
whispering her name. Patricia, after sleepless hours,
crept from her bed to Barbara's room, longing for
some assurance, she knew not what, some breath of
the old girlish confidences to melt the ice that seemed
to have congealed between them. And Barbara,
with the first phantom of softened feeling she had
known that night, took the other into her arms.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But it was she who comforted, whispering words
that she knew were empty, caressing the younger
girl with a touch that held no tremor, no hint of
those anguished visions that had floated through the
leaden silences of her soul.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Till at last, Patricia, half-reassured, smiled and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page325" id="page325" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;325]</span>
fell asleep; while Barbara, her loose gold hair drifting
across the pillow, her bare arm nestling the
dark, braided head beside her, lay stirless, staring
into the shadows, where the pale glimmer of the
Buddha floated, a ghostly <i style="text-shadow: none;">chiaroscuro</i>.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page326" id="page326" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXL" id="chXL" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XL<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE SHADOW OF A TO-MORROW</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Nikko's</span> thin street, with its gigantic isle of
cryptomeria, was a shimmer of gold, a
flicker of crimson and mandarin-blue. All
the town was out of doors, for it was the <i style="text-shadow: none;">matsuri</i>,
the local festival of Ieyasu, the great <i style="text-shadow: none;">shogun</i> deity,
when the ancient furniture and treasures of the temple
are carried in priestly processional through the
streets. The path of the pageant was lined with
spectators: old country-women with shaven eyebrows
and burnished, blackened teeth, and with hair
tightly plastered in old-fashioned wheels and pinions;
children in kaleidoscopic dress, frantically
dragged by older girls with pink paper flowers in
their stiff black hair; men sitting sedately on sober-colored
<i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>, bowing to pedestrian acquaintances
with elaborate and stereotyped ceremony. In the
moldy shade above a grim, wizened row of images
of the god of justice, was nailed a sign-board:
"Everybody are require not to broke the trees."
Beside the moss-covered replicas a booth had
been erected for foreign spectators. It was crowded
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page327" id="page327" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;327]</span>
with tourists�a bank of perspiring, fan-fluttering
humanity. Up and down trudged post-card sellers,
and <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i> bearers with trays of shallow, lacquer cups.
The air shimmered with a fine white dust from the
thousands of wooden clogs, and the trees were sibilant
with the tumult of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">semi</i>.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The procession seemed interminable. Priests
rode on horseback, clothed in black gauze robes with
stoles of gold brocade and queer, winged hats. Acolytes
marched afoot in green or yellow with stoles of
black, like huge parti-colored beetles. Groups of
bearers in white <i style="text-shadow: none;">houri</i> carried brass altar furniture,
great drums fantastically painted, ancient chain-armor
and tall banners of every tint. The center of
interest was a sacred <i style="text-shadow: none;">mikoshi</i>, or palanquin, holding
the divine symbols, elaborately carved and gold-lacquered,
borne by sixty men in white, with cloths of
like hue bound turban-wise about their foreheads.
Around these circled drum-beaters and pipe-players,
making an indescribable medley of sounds. The god
entered into his devotees. The palanquin tossed like
the waves of the sea. The bearers howled and
chanted gutturally. Sweat poured from their faces.
Some of them smiled and danced as they staggered
on under the immense bearing-poles.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Austen Ware saw the strain on Barbara's face.
"You are tired," he said. "Let us go back to the
hotel."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Where is Patsy?" she asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page328" id="page328" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;328]</span>
"She went with the bishop to see the priestesses
dance at the temple. But we can skip that."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He drew her out of the crowd and they walked
slowly down a side street to the road that skirts the
brawling Alpine torrent, rushing between its steep
stone banks. Here the spray filled the air with a
cool mist and the westerning sun tied the seething
water with silver tasseling. Caravans of panier-laden
Chinese ponies passed them, led by women in
tight blue breeches with sweat-bands about their
heads, and squads of uncomfortable tourists bound
to Chuzenji, the summer capital of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Corps Diplomatique</i>,
crumpled in sagging red-blanketed chairs
hanging from the bearing-poles of lurching, bronze-muscled
coolies. Young peasant girls trotted by
swinging baskets of yellow asters and purple morning-glories.
A <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> carried a baby with gay-colored
dolls and painted cats of <i style="text-shadow: none;">papier-m�ch�</i> tied
behind it, on its way to the family shrine where the
toys could be blessed. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> man was smiling,
but his cough rattled against Barbara's heart. A
line of white-robed Buddhist pilgrims trudged along
under mushroom hats, with rosaries crossed over
their breasts and little bells tinkling at their girdles
on their way to worship the Sun on the sacred
mountain of Nantai-Zan. Now and then the cut-velvet
of the hills rolled back to display clumps of
dwellings�the wizard-gray of thatched roofs set in
a rippling sea of leaves�and green flights of worn
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page329" id="page329" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;329]</span>
stone steps, staggering up to weird old temples
where droning priests were ever at prayer. At the
bottom of the road the stream narrowed to a gorge,
spanned by the sacred red-lacquer bridge which no
foot save the Emperor's may ever tread. On the
farther side the wooded hills rose in fantastic, top-heavy
shapes like a mad artist's dream. Everywhere
they were split and seamed by landslide,
gashed by torrents and typhoon, but covered with a
wealth and splendor of color. Here and there century-old
cryptomeria stood like gray-green bronze
pillars, towering over younger forests as straight
and symmetrical as Noah's-ark trees.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As they walked, Ware chatted of his trip up the
China coast�an interesting recital that took Barbara
insensibly out of herself. More than once he looked
at her curiously. Since that fateful hour when he
had stood behind the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i>, he, like Barbara, had
gone through much to look so unflurried. He had
known moments of bitterness that were galling and
stinging, and that left behind them a sense of degradation.
But he held to his course. So short-lived
a thing as her love for Daunt must wither! "It will
pass," he had told himself, "and she will turn to
me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The trip to Nikko had encouraged him. It had
been the time of the bishop's regular spring visit and
Barbara had welcomed the opportunity to leave
Tokyo, which was so full of painful memories. Patricia
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page330" id="page330" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span>
adored Japan's "Temple Town" and Ware
had joined the party there with as little delay as
was seemly. In the three days of the poignant
mountain air Barbara had seemed to Patricia to be
more like her old self. She could not guess the
strength of the effort this had cost or the fierceness
of the fight Barbara's pride was making.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was sunset when they mounted the steep road
to the hotel�a long, two-storied, modern structure,
whose gardens and red balconies gave it a subtle
Japanese flavor. On one side of the building the
ground fell in a precipitous descent to the rocky bed
of the river, whose rush made a restful monotone
like wind sighing through linden trees. Behind it
the height rose abruptly, and up its side clambered
a twisting path, from which a light foot-bridge
sprang to the upper piazzas. The path led to a shrine
a hundred yards above, set beside an old wisteria
tree, musical with the chirp of the "silver-eye," and
fluttering with countless paper arrows of prayer.
Before it were two wooden benches, and from this
eyrie one could look down on the hotel with its
graceful balconies, and far below the tumbling
stream with its guarded red-lacquer arch.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ware walked with Barbara up the path to the
foot-bridge. Near its entrance a small stand had
been placed and on it was a phonograph, its ungainly
trumpet pointing down toward the stretch of lawn.
A heavy red-bearded man, in a warm frock-coat, a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page331" id="page331" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
white waistcoast and a silk hat pushed far back on
his head, was laboring over this, and a plump lady
stood near-by, fanning her beaming face with a
pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They greeted Barbara heartily.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Good afternoon," said the husband. "You can't
guess what me and Martha are up to, can you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> concert to-night?" she hazarded.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Right!" he said. "First crack out of the box,
too! I'm going to take a record of it." He tapped
the cylinder. "This is a composition of my own. I
leave it out here all night to harden, and then I give
it a three days' acid bath that makes it as hard as
steel. It'll last for ever. Now what do you suppose
I'm going to do with the record? I'm going to give
it to you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The lady beside him nodded and smiled. "He's
been planning it ever since he heard you say the
other day that you liked <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> music," she said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You see," he went on with a laugh. "I haven't
forgotten that line of talk your uncle gave me on
the train, my first day in Japland. It did me a lot of
good. I guess what he doesn't know about it isn't
worth telling," he added with a glance at Ware.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He is an authority, of course," said Ware.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Well, I'm an authority, too�on phonographs.
And if you'd accept this, Miss Fairfax�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I shall be <i style="text-shadow: none;">delighted</i>!" said Barbara warmly. "I
shall value it very, very highly."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page332" id="page332" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span>
She smiled back at them over her shoulder. The
frank, honest kindliness of the couple pleased her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The piazza opened into a small sitting-room with
cool bamboo chairs and porti�res of thin green silk
stenciled with maple-leaves.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Will you wait a moment, Barbara?" asked Ware.
"I have something to show you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She stopped, looking at him with a trace of confusion.
"Certainly," she answered. "What is it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He put a folded paper into her hands. "To-day
is the anniversary of our meeting," he said. "This
is a memento."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She took it with a puzzled look and scrutinized it.
Wonder filled her face. "You have made over your
yacht to me!" she cried.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"My engagement gift," he said. "She is your
namesake; I want her to be yours."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A flush crept over her cheek. She knew the
yacht was his favorite possession and the action
touched her. At the same time it brought swiftly
home to her, in a concrete way, a numbing reminder
of the imminence of her marriage.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The deed has been recorded," he went on, "and
the sailing-master and crew have signed articles under
the new owner. Perhaps you will let me come
aboard of her to hear that <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> record," he added
whimsically. "There's a phonograph in her outfit."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She smiled, a little tremulously. "You are most
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page333" id="page333" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;333]</span>
kind, Austen," she said. "I�I don't know what to
say."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Then say nothing," he answered cheerfully. He
stepped to the door and drew aside the porti�re. She
was agitated, feeling unable to meet the situation in
the conventional way. At the threshold she paused
and held out her hand.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He bent and kissed it. She half-hesitated, but in
the pause there was a laughing voice and a footstep
in the hall.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's Patsy," she said, and passed quickly out.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As Ware walked back across the foot-bridge, the
proprietor of the phonograph called to him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I clean forgot to ask the young lady where to
send this record," he said. "Do you know her address?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It will be more or less uncertain, I fancy," said
Ware. "But her yacht is in Yokohama harbor. It
is named the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>. You might send it there."</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page334" id="page334" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;334]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLI" id="chXLI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">UNFORGOT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> sharp sense of imminence which had
come to Barbara with Austen Ware's gift remained
with her that evening. The dinner
was none too merry. For the first time Patricia had
failed to be enthused over the Nikko <i style="text-shadow: none;">matsuri</i>, and
the bishop, since Haru's disappearance, had lacked
his usual sallies. Barbara had told him nothing of
her visit to the house in the Street-of-the-Misty-Valley;
to speak of it would probe her own wound too
deeply.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The after-dinner piazza exhaled the bouquet of
evening cigars and the chatter of tourists. Far
below, across the gorge, lights twinkled in native
doorways and <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> glimmered like oblong yellow
lanterns. The air was heavy with balsam odors, and
beneath the trees, sparkling now with incandescents,
tiny black moths had replaced the sunlight flashing
dragon-flies. Sitting in a semicircle on straw mats
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> players at length mingled their <i style="text-shadow: none;">outr�</i>,
twittering cadences with the soft thunder of the
water.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As the musicians finished their last number and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page335" id="page335" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span>
trooped away, Patricia yawned and rose. "Here,"
she observed, "is where little Patsy puts her face and
hands to bed. This mountain air is perfectly demoralizing!"
The two girls went up-stairs together.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At her own room Patsy put her arms around the
other and kissed her. "Oh, I wonder if you're
<i style="text-shadow: none;">sure</i>!" she said. Then she fled inside.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara threw open the window of her room and
drew a low stool to the balcony. "I wonder!" she
said aloud. With elbows on the railing and chin in
hands, she looked long and earnestly into the dark
void. Why was she no longer able to warm to all
this beauty and meaning? These cryptomeria
shadows, dreaming of the faded splendors of a feudal
past�the streets along which legions of pilgrims
had walked muttering prayers to their gods�the
marvelous lacquered temples of red and gold,
wrought by patient love of long dead yesterdays, in
handiwork to which time had given a softened glory
such as those who dreamed them never saw�the
heavenly soaring of pagoda doves against the Ambassadors
sky�the shrines worn with their centuries of
worship and dancing and booming bells! Forgetting�and
remembering no more�would that be a soul-task
too hard for her? Was all that had been instinct
with wonder and joy to be henceforth but emptiness
and desolation�because an ideal had gone from her
for ever? She thought of the belled and rosaried pilgrims
climbing Nantai-Zan. She seemed to see the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page336" id="page336" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
faint, far glimmer of their lanterns. Beyond that
pilgrimage over dark crags and grim precipices lay
for them the sunrise of hope!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the room behind her hung one of the famous
prints of Hiroshige, the great Japanese master�a
group of peasants crossing the long skeleton bridge
of Enoshima. She thought of this now, and suddenly
all the spot had meant to her welled over her.
She saw again the enchanted Island�the long
shaded stairways of gray stone, the brown-legged
girls gathering seaweed, and beyond the old seawall
the gulls calling to their mates. She saw the generations
of lovers pass one by one before Ben-ten's altar,
murmuring their hearts' desire. Daunt's arms
seemed to be again around her. She felt his kisses,
heard his voice as they walked under the singing
trees�walked and dreamed and forgot that pain was
ever born into the world.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She started. A horse was coming up the hill, his
hoofs thudding softly in the loose shale. The rider
dismounted at the porch. A moment later, crop in
hand, he passed beneath her window. The light fell
on his face. Barbara's heart bounded and then stood
still, for she recognized him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"There has never been another woman to me, Barbara!"
Mocking voices seemed to shout it satirically
from the emptiness, and against the dark Haru's
face rose up before her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page337" id="page337" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
She shivered. She went in and closed the window,
drawing down the blind with a nervous haste.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But she could not shut out that face, and in spite
of herself her thoughts had their will with her. What
was Daunt doing there? Patsy had said that he was
in Chuzenji. But that was only a handful of miles
away. He looked worn and older�he had been suffering,
too! She hugged this knowledge to her heart.
He knew, of course, why she had ended it all�<i style="text-shadow: none;">Haru
would have told him</i>!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She clenched her hands and began to pace up and
down the room, now stopping to peer with bright
miserable eyes into the mirror, now throwing herself
into a chair. Once she put her hand into her bosom,
groping for her father's picture�to withdraw it
with an added pang. For she had forgotten; she had
lost the locket the afternoon of her drive with Patricia.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A knock came at the door, and a bell-boy handed
her a penciled note.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She read it wonderingly, then, hastily smoothing
her hair, went quickly along the hall to the sitting-room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the dimly lighted room a figure came toward
her from the shadow. It was Philip Ware.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page338" id="page338" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLII" id="chXLII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">PHIL MAKES AN APPEAL</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> youth who stood before her now, however,
was not the Phil Barbara had seen at
Mukojima. There was no hint of spruce
grooming in his attire; it was overlaid with the dust
and grime of the road. The jaunty, self-satisfied
look was ravaged by something cringing, that suggested
sleeplessness and undefined anxiety. Why
should he come at such an hour�and to her? The
distaste which her first view of him had inspired returned
with added force as she felt the touch of his
hand and heard herself say:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"So this is 'Phil.' I have often heard of you from
your brother. Have you seen him?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No," he said. "I don't want him to know I'm
here�yet. I�I came to see you." He paused,
twisting his cloth cap in his fingers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He was in a desperate strait. His brother's silence
since his visit to the house in Aoyama (of which
Phil had learned from the servant) had seemed to
mean the worst. The place had contained sufficient
documents in evidence as to his mode of living, and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page339" id="page339" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;339]</span>
the reflection opened gloomy vistas of poverty from
which he turned with abject fear and dread. There
was one alternative, and this, a grisly shadow, had
stalked beside him since an evening when he had
dined with Bersonin. It had peopled his sleep with
terrifying visions which even Haru and the brandy
had been unable to banish, and his waking hours had
been haunted by the expert's yellowish eyes. Between
devil and deep sea, he had heard of his brother's
engagement, and the wild thought of appealing
to him through Barbara had come to him as a forlorn
hope. Now, face to face with her, he found the
words difficult to say.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Won't you sit down?" she said, and took a chair
opposite him, looking at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I ought to apologize for a rig like this," he went
on, glancing at his sorry raiment, "but I came in a
friend's motor, and I'm going back to-night. I
thought you wouldn't mind, now�now that you are
engaged to marry Austen. You are, aren't you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She inclined her head. "Yes," she said slowly,
"I have promised to marry him."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Then you know him pretty well, and you know
that he�that he doesn't altogether approve of me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I have never heard him say that," she interrupted
quickly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's true, though," he rejoined bitterly. "He's always
been down on me. I'm not staid enough for
him. He made his money by grubbing, and he thinks
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page340" id="page340" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
everybody else ought to do the same. It's�it's the
matter of money I want to speak to you about."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He paused again. "Yes?" she said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Since I left college," he went on, "Austen has always
made me an allowance. But I've been out here
a year now, and I�well, you know what the East is.
I've had to live as other young fellows do, and I've
spent more than he gives me. I've�played some,
too, and then this spring I got hit hard at the races.
It was just a run of bad luck, when I had expected to
square myself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He was eager and voluble now. She seemed to be
considering�he was making an impression. He
might come out all right after all! His volatile spirits
rose.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You see," he said, "Austen never overlooks anything.
He's as likely as not to cut me off entirely
and leave me high and dry. I�I thought perhaps
you would�you might get him to do the decent
thing and help me out of the hole. If I once got
straight I'd stay so, but I want a fair allowance. It
isn't as if he had to work for what I spend. He
ought to give it to me. I can't go on as I am; I'm
in debt�in deep. I can't take up my <i style="text-shadow: none;">chits</i> at the
club. I'm living in Tokyo now�in a Japanese house
in Aoyama that a friend has loaned me�because I
haven't the face to show myself in Yokohama!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He twirled his cap and looked up at her. "That
reminds me," he said, with a sudden recollection.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page341" id="page341" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;341]</span>
"Austen was there the other day when I was away,
and afterward I found something of yours which he
must have dropped. Here it is. It has your name
on it." He handed her a small locket with a broken
chain.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She took it with an exclamation. She was staring
at him strangely. "This house you speak of�whose
is it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It belongs to Mr. Daunt."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You mean�you say�that you have been living
in it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes. Why?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had risen slowly to her feet, her face hotly
suffused. "Then�then Haru�" She spoke in a dry
whisper.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He started, looking at her with quick, resentful
suspicion. "What do you know about Haru?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Never mind! Never mind that! I want to know.
Haru�she is�Mr. Daunt was not�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He never saw her in his life so far as I know,"
he answered sulkily. "What has that to do with it?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For an instant she looked at him without a word,
her fingers working. Then she began to laugh, in a
low tone, wildly, chokingly. "Of course! Of course!
What has that to do with it? What you want is more
money, isn't it! That is all you came to tell me!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He, too, was on his feet now, uncertain and mistrustful.
Was she making game of him? He saw
Barbara's gaze go past him�to fasten on something
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page342" id="page342" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;342]</span>
in the background. He turned. In the doorway with
its maple-leaf porti�re stood Austen Ware.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's laugh had fallen in a shuddering breath
that was like a sob. "Here is your brother now," she
said. "Austen, Phil and I have been getting acquainted.
And what do you think? He has found
my lost locket." She held it up toward him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He had come toward them. In the dim light his
face looked very white, and his eyes glittered like
quicksilver. He held out his hand.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why, Phil!" he exclaimed. "This is a great surprise.
When did you arrive, and are you at this
hotel?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil had stood shamefaced. At the tone, however,
which seemed an earnest of renewed favor, he
flushed with relief. "I've just come," he answered�"in
a friend's motor, and I must go back at once. But
I'll come up again by train to-morrow, if you'd like
me to."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Very well," was Ware's reply. "We'll wait till
then for our talk. I'll come and see you off." Neither
of the others caught the tense repression in the
tone or realized that his smile was forced and unnatural,
as he added: "We must put a ban on late hours,
Barbara, if you are to climb Nantai-Zan to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She went to the door, her thoughts in a tumult, a
wild exhilaration possessing her. She wanted to
laugh and to cry. The black, cold mist that had enveloped
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page343" id="page343" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
her had broken, and the warm sunlight was
looking again into her heart.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Good night, Phil," she said. "Thank you so much
for�for bringing me the locket. You can't guess
how much it meant to me!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As the silk drapery fell behind her, the self-control
dropped from Austen Ware's face, and a hell of
hatred sprang into it. Chance had given Phil the one
card that spelled disaster, and chance had prompted
him to play it. In Barbara's mind Daunt stood
absolved! He saw the castle he had been building
tottering to its fall. He turned on his brother a
countenance convulsed with a fury of passion from
which Phil shrank startled.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Come," he said in a muffled voice. "We can't
talk here." He led the way through the hall and
across the foot-bridge to the hillside, gloomy now,
for the incandescents in the trees had been extinguished.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil followed, his face gone white. A rack stood
at the outer door, and his fingers, slipping along it as
he passed, closed on a riding-crop.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the shrubberied slope Ware turned. One
twitching hand dropped on his brother's shoulder;
the other pointed down the path.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Go, damn you!" he said, "and never show your
face to me again! Not one cent shall you have from
me! Now nor hereafter�I have taken care of that!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil lifted the crop and struck him across the head�two
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page344" id="page344" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
savage, heavy blows. Ware staggered and
fell backward down the steep declivity, his weight
crashing through the bushes with a dull, sickening
sound.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a silence in which Phil did not breathe.
The stars seemed suddenly very bright. From an
open window came a woman's shrill, careless laugh,
threading the hushed roar of the water below. The
lighted <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> across the river seemed to be drifting
nearer. He could see the glow of a forge in a native
smithy, like an angry, red-lidded eye. The crop fell
from his grasp. He leaned over, staring into the
dark.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Austen!" he whispered hoarsely. "Austen!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was no response. As he gazed fearfully into
the shadow, the rising moon, peeping through a
bank of cloud, deluged the landscape with a misty
gossamer. The light fell on the phonograph. Phil
recoiled, for its long metal trumpet seemed a rigid
arm stretched to seize him. With a low cry he turned
and fled.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He skirted the hill to the hotel stables, where Bersonin's
huge motor-car stood silent. The Japanese
chauffeur was curled up in the tonneau, fast asleep.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Five minutes later Barbara heard the throb of the
great mechanism speeding down the shadowy cryptomeria
road.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page345" id="page345" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLIII" id="chXLIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE SECRET THE RIVER KEPT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt</span> had dined cheerlessly in the deserted
dining-room. Afterward, shrinking from the
gay piazzas, he had struck off for a long rambling
walk. Only the frail moonlight, glimpsing
through a cloudy sky, lay over the landscape, when,
returning, worn but in no mood for sleep, he found
himself at the hill shrine looking down on the white
hotel with its long red balconies, brightened here and
there by the lighted window of some late-retiring
guest.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His few days at Chuzenji had passed in a kind of
stifled fever. The report of Barbara's engagement
had added its poisoned barb. That morning, however,
a careless remark had torn across his mood as
sheet-lightning tears the weaving dusk. Tokyo was
talking of it�of <i style="text-shadow: none;">him</i>!�making a jest of that sweet,
dead thing in his heart? The thought had stung his
pride, and there had grown in him a sharp sense of
humiliation at his own cowardice. The afternoon
had found him riding down the mountain trail to
Nikko. To-morrow he would go back to Tokyo�to
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page346" id="page346" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
the round of gaieties that would now be hateful, and
to his work.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He put out his hand to one of the benches in the
deep pine-shadow, but drew it back with a sharp
breath. A sliver of the warped wood had pierced his
knuckle to the bone.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Frowning, he wrapped the bleeding member in
his handkerchief and sat down at the bench's other
end, bitterly absorbed. The vagrant, intermittent
moonlight touched the tumbling water below with
creeping silver, and on the horizon, where the cloud-bank
frayed away, one white constellation swung
low, a cluster of lamps in golden chains. But Daunt's
thought had no place for the delicate beauty of the
night. His pipe was long since cold, and he knocked
out the dead ashes against the bench, and did not
relight it. He thought of Tokyo, that to-morrow
would stretch so blank and irksome, of the humdrum
tedium of the Chancery, in which a few days ago he
had worked so blithely. Then all had been interest
and beauty. Now the future stretched before him
dull and savorless, an arid Desert of Gobi, through
whose thirsty waste he must trudge on for ever to a
comfortless goal.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">How long he sat there with bowed head he could
not have told, but at length he rose heavily to his
feet As he did so he became aware of a sound below
him�a footfall, coming toward him. It crossed a
bar of the moonlight.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page347" id="page347" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;347]</span>
He shrank, and a tremor ran over him, for it was
Barbara.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had thrown over her a loose cloak, and a bit
of soft, clinging lace showed between its dark edges.
Her brilliant hair was loosely gathered in a single
braid, and in the moonlight it shone like beaten
copper against the vivid pallor of her face. He sat
stirless, smitten with confusion, conscious that a
movement must betray him. A painful embarrassment
enveloped him, a fastidious sense of shrinking
from her sight of him. He felt a dull wave of resentment
that an antic irony of circumstance should
have brought them beneath the same roof�to make
him seem the moody pursuer, the unwelcome trespasser
on her reserve�and that now thrust him
into a position which at any hazard he would have
shunned. But all thought of himself, all feeling save
one vanished, when, with sudden piteous abandon,
she threw herself on her knees by the bench and
broke into slow sobs, shuddering and tearless.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In that outbreak of emotion, were not alone the
pent-up pain and humiliation she had suffered, or the
desperate joy of that evening's knowledge. There
were in it, too, grief and compunction, dismay and
doubt of the future. She was engaged to Austen
Ware. Would Daunt ever forgive? Would he want
her�now? In the first realization of her error,
wound with the knowledge that he was so near her,
she had felt only joy; but in the silence of her room,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page348" id="page348" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;348]</span>
shock on shock had come the incredulous question,
the burning revulsion. A while she had lain wide-eyed,
but at length, sleepless, she had stolen out to
the balmy, fragrant night, craving its peace, longing
passionately for its soft shadows and the hovering
touch of the mountain's breath on her hair. And in
its friendly shadows the gust of feeling had swept
her from her feet.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The action took Daunt wholly by surprise. The
sound tore his heart like a ruthless talon, and drew
a hoarse word from his lips:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara!" It was little more than a whisper, but
she sprang erect with a gasp, her breath labored and
terror-stricken.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I�I beg pardon," he said, with a dry catch in his
throat. "Don't be frightened. I will go at once. I
should not have stayed. But you came so suddenly,
and I did not dream�I�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How strange that you should have been here!"
She thought he must hear the loud drumming of her
pulse.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He laughed�a hard, colorless little laugh. "Yes,"
he answered, "it seems so."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A mist blinded her eyes, for his tone carried to
her, even more sharply than had the look she had
seen from the balcony, a sense of the pain he had undergone.
In what words could she tell him?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You have been suffering," she said in a low
voice. "I see that. And it was my fault."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page349" id="page349" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;349]</span>
He gathered himself together with an effort of
will, to still the tingle that flashed along his nerves.
"It was quite sane and right, no doubt," he said.
"When I have learned to be honest enough with myself,
I shall see it so. My mistake was in ever dreaming
that I was worth one of your thoughts or a single
second's memory."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She turned her head abruptly. "Do you hear some
one talking? I thought I heard it as I came up the
path�like some one muttering to himself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He listened, but there was no sound.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I must have imagined it," she said. There was a
moment's pause, and presently she went on:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You have been thinking hard things of me. It is
natural that you should. And yet I�whatever you
think�whatever you do�that day in the cave, I was
not�was not�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You were nothing you should not have been,"
he replied rapidly. Her voice had sent a tremor
over him�he felt it with a new wave of the morning's
contempt. "I understand. There is nothing for
you to justify, nothing to regret."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She shook her head. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">We have left undone those
things which we ought to have done</i>," she quoted in
a low voice, "<i style="text-shadow: none;">and have done those things which we
ought not to have done, and there is no health in us</i>.
We all recite that every Sunday. I have something
now to confess to you. Won't you stand there in the
light? I�I want to see your face."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page350" id="page350" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;350]</span>
He stepped slowly into a bar of moonlight.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Why," she said, "you have hurt your hand!"
She made a quick step toward him, her eyes on the
stained bandage.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is nothing," he said hastily. "I struck it a little
while ago. What�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned, suddenly alert. A sharp whistle had
sounded below them, and bright points here and
there pricked the gloom. "They have turned on the
tree-lights," he said. There was a sound of voices on
the path. Some one ran across the foot-bridge.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Something has happened," she said. "What can
it be?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He made no reply. There had flashed to him a
quick realization of the position in which, unwittingly,
they had placed themselves. She must not be
seen at such an hour, in that lonely spot with him!
He knew the canons of the world he lived in! With
a hushed word he drew her back into the shadow.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The voices were speaking in Japanese, and now he
heard them clearly. "Some one is injured," he told
her. "He fell down the hillside, they think." A hurried
step crossed the bridge, and a voice, sharp and
peremptory, asked a question in nervous English.
Daunt chilled at the answer, turning to her, every
unselfish instinct alive to spare her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But she had heard a name. "It is Mr. Ware who is
hurt!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He grasped her wrist. "Wait!" he said hurriedly.
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page351" id="page351" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;351]</span>
"I beg you to go by the upper path to the side door."
But she caught away her arm and ran quickly down
the path.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt sprang up the hill, skirted the building,
gained its upper corridor, now simmering with excitement,
and crossed the bridge. Near its farther
end a small group stood about a figure, prostrate beside
the phonograph whose cylinder gleamed in the
lantern-light. By it Barbara was kneeling.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But something came between her gaze and the
pallid face�something which she saw with the distinctness
of a black paper silhouette on a white
ground: a glimmering object, unnoted by the rest,
which had lain half-concealed by a bush�something
that one day, a thousand years ago, had glittered
against Daunt's brown hair as he saluted her
from his horse! It was a riding-crop, whose Damascene
handle bore the device of a fox's head.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Two hours later the corridors were silent and the
bishop and Daunt sat together in the darkened
office, saying few words, both thinking of a man
lying straight and alone�and of a girl in an upper
room whose promise he had taken with him out of
the world. Daunt was to leave for Tokyo on the
early morning train. Half the night through he sat
there listening to the moan of the rising weather.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But a little while before the sky whitened to a
rainy dawn, a gray wraith glided along the upper
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page352" id="page352" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
piazza of the hotel. It crossed the foot-bridge to
the hillside.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara groped and found the crop. Across the
night she seemed to see an endless procession of
stolid, sulphur-colored figures, linked with thin, rattling
chains, filing into the humid, black mouth of a
mine. Shuddering, she swung the stick with all her
strength, and threw it from her down the steep, into
the water that roared and tumbled far below.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page353" id="page353" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLIV" id="chXLIV" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLIV<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE LAYING OF THE MINE</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Doctor Bersonin</span> lunched at the Tokyo
Club.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For three days the rain had fallen steadily,
in one of those seasons of torrential downpour which
in Japan are generally confined to the typhoon season
and which flood its low-lands, turn its creeks
into raging rivers and play havoc with its bridges.
For three days the sky had been a dull expanse of
pearl-gray, and the city a waste of drenched green
foliage and gleaming tile, whose roadways were
lines of brown mud with a surface of thin glue,
dotted with glistening umbrellas of oil-paper and
bamboo. Under their trickling eaves the shop-fronts,
dark and hollow and comfortless, had held
the red glow of <i style="text-shadow: none;">hibachi</i>; teamsters had shown bristling
tunics of rice-straw and loads covered with
saffron tarpaulin; <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick'sha</i> had reeled past with rubber
fronts tightly buttoned against the slanting
spears of rain, and the foreign carriages that
dragged by had borne coachmen swathed to the ears.
This morning, however, the rain had ceased and
wind had supervened.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page354" id="page354" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;354]</span>
The Club was cheerful, with a sprinkling of the
younger diplomatic set, Japanese business men and
journalists, all men of note. The up-stairs dining-room
was full of talk as the expert arrived and
chose a small table by himself.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">While he waited, the boy brought him one of the
English-printed newspapers, and he cast his eyes
over the head-lines. He read:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin" style="text-shadow: none;">SQUADRON'S SAILING ORDERS</p>

<hr class="hrs" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">To Leave To-morrow Morning. An</p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">Answer to the Alarmists.</p>

<hr class="hrs" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">All Differences Between the Two Governments</p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">to Yield to</p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">Diplomacy.</p>

<hr class="hrs" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the other side was the caption in smaller type:</p>

<p class="cnobmargin" style="text-shadow: none;">BEAR RAID ON MARKETS</p>

<hr class="hrs" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">Mysterious Selling Movement</p>
<p class="cnomargins" style="text-shadow: none;">Causes Uneasiness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He read the latter despatch�an Associated Press
wire, under a New York date-line:</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"At noon to-day the bear movement,
heretofore regarded as a natural reaction
following an over-advancement, and hence
of purely academic interest, suddenly assumed
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page355" id="page355" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;355]</span>
such proportions as to make the outlook
one of anxiety. It seems significant
that before the Wall Street opening this
morning the London market responded to
an attack of the same nature. In an era of
industrial prosperity and general peace
such a phenomenon is alarming, and a serious
decline is anticipated in some quarters.
The short sales which were such a factor
in to-day's market were so distributed that
it seems impossible to trace them to any
single interest."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin's face expressed nothing. He folded the
crackling sheet and laid it to one side.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Most of the comment about him turned on the
departure of the Squadron. Since the royal death,
whose announcement had so abruptly ended the
festivities, the black battle-ships had lain motionless
in the bay. The appointment of a regent of confessedly
more positive policy had given rise to many
speculations, and the apostles of calamity had seized
the opportunity to sow the seeds of disquiet. The
great world, however, had as yet given little thought
to their prognostications. The bourses had gone
higher and higher. Only in diplomatic circles,
where the mercury is habitually unquiet, had there
been perceptible effect. To-day the comment showed
a sub-tone of relief.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The doctor ate little. He left the <i style="text-shadow: none;">petit verre</i> with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page356" id="page356" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span>
his coffee untouched, signed his <i style="text-shadow: none;">chit</i> and went down
to his automobile.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Bersonin must be under the weather," one of the
men at another table observed, as he passed them.
"He looks like a putty image."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Curious chap," remarked the other. "Got a lot
in his head, no doubt. Some queer stories afloat
about him, but I don't suppose there's anything in
them."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other lit his cigar reflectively. "I can't somehow
'go' him, myself," he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin was whirled to his house, and presently
was in his laboratory with its glass shelves, its books
and its wall-safe. A cheerful fire burned in the grate
against the dampness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He began to walk restlessly up and down the
floor. To-day his government contract expired and
Japan had not asked its renewal. He thought of
this with a sudden recrudescence of the hatred he
had nurtured for the Empire. This had been based
on fancied slights, on his failure to receive a decoration,
on the surveillance he had lately imagined had
been kept on his movements. Well, to-morrow
would repay all with interest! There was no hitch
in the plan which chance had aided so well. The
Roost was the one house on the Yokohama Bluff
that could have served his purpose, planted on the
cliff-edge and in line with the anchorage. And it
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page357" id="page357" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;357]</span>
had happened to be in the hands of this weak fool
for his cat's-paw!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His great, cunning brain turned to the future�to
that vast career which his stupendous egotism had
painted for himself. His discovery was so epoch-making,
so terrifying in its possibilities to civilization,
that it had nonplussed him. It was too big to
handle. He had made the greatest dynamic engine
the world had seen�possibly the greatest it would
ever see�and yet he knew that the Ambassador had
laid his finger on the truth when he had said:
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Humanity would revolt! The man who knew the
secret would be too dangerous to be at large!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But with wealth�wealth enough to buy men and
privilege�what might he not do? It would take
time, and scheming, and secrecy, but he had them
all. And the great secret was always his, and his
alone! It would make him more powerful than
Emperors, for he who possessed it, with the means
to use it, could laugh at fleets and fortifications.
Before the machines that he should build the greatest
steel-clad that was ever floated would vanish like
smoke! He clenched his great hands and his massive
frame quivered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The future, the future!" he said in a low, tense
voice. "I shall be greater than Caesar, greater than
Napoleon, for I shall hold the force that can make
and unmake kings! So surely as force rules the
world, so surely shall I, Bersonin, rule the world!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page358" id="page358" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span>
A knock came at the door and Phil entered. He
was as pale as the doctor and his clothing was
soaked with the rain. Without a word Bersonin
locked the door, wheeled an arm-chair before the
blaze, pushed him into it and mixed him a glass of
spirits. Then he stood looking at him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's all right," said Phil. "The tripod fitted to a
hair. It can't be seen from either side, and I've sent
the boy away and locked the house."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Good," said Bersonin. "All is ready, then. The
mechanism is set for the moment of daybreak. Our
gains will be enormous, for in spite of the selling the
market is up. There has been a little distrust of the
situation here and there, though the optimists have
had their way. And this latent distrust will add to
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">d�b�cle</i> when it comes. We are just in time, for
the Squadron has its sailing-orders for to-morrow.
Strange how near we were to failure! Who could
have foreseen the death of the King? And the rains,
too. They say it is doubtful if the trains will run
to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's hand, holding the drink, shook and wavered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The damned clock-work in the thing!" he said.
"I could hear it all the way�I thought every one
would hear it. I can't get the ticking out of my
brain!" He set down the glass and turned a glittering
gaze on the other.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It's worth all that comes from it," he said. "You
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page359" id="page359" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span>
play me fair! Do you understand? You'll play me
fair, or I'll settle with you!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The doctor smiled, a smile of horrible cunning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"As you settled with your brother?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil shrank into the chair speechless, looking at
him with trepidation in his eyes. The shot had
gone home.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pshaw!" said Bersonin. "Do you take me for a
fool not to guess? Come, we needn't quarrel. Our
interests are the same. Go home, now, to your
Japanese butterfly�and wait!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> Chapel was but sparsely filled. From
where she sat, Barbara, through the open
door, could see the willows along the disconsolate
roadway whipping in the fleering dashes of
wind. A woman trudged by, bare-legged, her
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> tucked knee-high, the inevitable, swaddled
baby on her back. The hot, fibrous song of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">semi</i>
had died to a thin humming, like bees in an old
orchard. Across the bishop's voice she heard the
plaintive call of a huckster, swinging by in slow dogtrot
with panier-pole on shoulder, and the chirr of a
singing-frog under the hedge.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The service was in the vernacular, and though she
tried to follow it in her <i style="text-shadow: none;">Romaji</i> prayer-book�whose
words were printed in Roman letters instead of the
Japanese ideograph�the lines were meaningless,
and she could not fasten her mind on them.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had reached a point in these few tragical days
where her mind, overwrought with its own pain,
had acquired a kind of benumbing lassitude that was
not apathy and yet was far removed from spontaneous
feeling. Daunt's presence that dreadful night on
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page361" id="page361" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span>
the hillside�his confusion�his bleeding hand�his
round-about return to the hotel�all this, at the sight
of the Damascene crop in the bushes, had flashed to
her mind in damnable sequence. And yet something
deep and unfathomed within her had driven her to
the obliteration of that mute evidence. Austen Ware
had slipped and fallen�such was the universal verdict.
The truth was sealed for ever in the urn now
bound over-seas to its last resting-place. She alone,
she thought, knew the secret of that Nikko tragedy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With the next daylight the storm had broken and
the ensuing gloomy weather had formed a dismal
setting for gloomier scenes, through which she had
moved dully and mechanically. When all was over,
to Patricia's sorrow, she had not returned to the
Embassy, but had gone immediately to her uncle's.
The pity offered her�though not openly expressed,
since her engagement had not been formally announced�hurt
her like physical blows, and the quiet
of the Ts'kiji rectory was some solace. To-night, an
unwelcome task lay before her. She was to visit the
yacht�now, by a satiric freak of chance, legally her
own!�to seal the private papers of the man whose
deed of gift might not now be recalled.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she sat listening to the meaningless reading
and the sighing of the wind above the Chapel roof,
Barbara's eyes on the stained-glass figure in the rose-window
were full of a wistful loneliness. If her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page362" id="page362" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
father were only alive�if he could be near her now!
Unconsciously her gaze strayed across the hedges,
to the gray roof of the old temple where lived the
eccentric solitary to whom her thought insistently
recurred. In her trouble she longed to go to him,
with a longing the greater because it seemed fantastic
and illogical. She recalled suddenly the quaint
six-year-old of the huge clogs and patched <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>�Ishikichi,
troubled over the giving up of the family
establishment, puzzling his baby brain over the hard
things of life.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was startled by a sound outside�the single,
shrill, high scream of a horse in some stable near at
hand. It cut through a pause in the service, sharp,
curdling, like a cry of mortal fear. A baby, near
Barbara, awoke and began to cry and the mother
soothed it with whispered murmurings.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly there arose a strange rattling, a groaning
of timbers. The bishop ceased reading. People
were rising to their feet. The building was shifting,
swaying, with a sickening upward vibration, as
though it were being trotted on some Brobdingnagian
knee. Barbara felt a qualm like the first touch of
<i style="text-shadow: none;">mal de mer</i>. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">Ji-shin! Ji-shin!</i>" rose the cry, and
there was a rush for the open air. In another moment
she found herself out of doors with the frightened
crowd.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">It was her first experience of earthquake, and the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page363" id="page363" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span>
terror had gripped her bodily. The wet trees were
waving to and fro like gigantic fans, and a dull moan
like an echo in a subterranean cavern seemed to issue
from the very ground. A section of tiling slid from
the Chapel roof with a crash. "Rather severe that,
for Tokyo," said the bishop at her elbow, where he
stood calmly, watch in hand. "Almost two minutes
and vertical movement."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Two minutes!" she gasped. She had thought it
twenty.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The nauseating swing had ceased, but in an instant,
with a vicious wrench, it began again. "The
secondary oscillations," he said. "It will all be
over in a ..."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he spoke, the air swelled with a horrible,
crunching, grinding roar, like the complaint of a
million riven timbers. Across the lane a sinister
dust-cloud sprang into the air like a monstrous hand
with spread fingers. "It is one of the temples!" said
the bishop, and hurried with the rest, Barbara following
him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The paved yard was filling with a throng. Agitated
priests and acolytes ran hither and thither and
slate-colored nuns, with shaven heads and pale,
frightened faces, peered through the bamboo-lattices
of the nunnery. The newer temple faced the open
space as usual, but across the hedged garden no
ornate roof now thrust up its Tartar gables. Instead
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page364" id="page364" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;364]</span>
was a huddle of wreckage, upon which lay the huge
roof, crumpled and shattered, like the fragments of
a gigantic mushroom. From the tangle projected
beam ends, coiled about with painted monsters, and
here and there in the cluttered <i style="text-shadow: none;">d�bris</i> lay great
images of unfamiliar deities. Over all hung a fine
yellow dust, choking and penetrating.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">What was under those ruins? Barbara shivered.
She was quite unconscious of the mud and the pelting
rain. The bishop drew her under the temple
porch, and they stood together watching the men
now working with mattocks, saws and with loose
beams for levers, prying up a corner of the fallen
roof. It seemed an hour they had stood there, when
a priest, bareheaded, his robes caked with mud, came
from the clustering crowd. The bishop questioned
him in Japanese. Barbara guessed from his face
what the priest had answered! She waited quiveringly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Through the bishop's mind swift thoughts were
passing. He knew by hearsay of the recluse�knew
that he was not an Oriental. He had often seen the
placard on the little gate: "Maker of Buddhas." He
had never passed it without a pang. It seemed a
satirical derision of the holiest ideal of the West�a
type and sign of reversion, a sardonic mockery of
the Creed of Christ. He was a priest holding the
torch of the true light to this alien people, and here,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page365" id="page365" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;365]</span>
a dark shadow across its brightness, had stood this
derisive denial. Yet now, perhaps, this man stood
on the threshold of the hereafter�and he was a man
of his own race!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned to Barbara. "Wait here for me," he
said. "I am going in. I will come back to you as
soon as I can."</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page366" id="page366" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;366]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLVI" id="chXLVI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLVI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE GOLDEN CRUCIFIX</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> bishop went quickly through the crowd
to a gap under the great gables, where the
beams had been sawed through and the rubbish
shoveled to one side, making a difficult way
into the interior. The enormous span of the roof
had sunk sidewise, splitting its supporting beams
and bending the walls outward, but its great ridge
had remained intact and it now stretched, a squat,
ungainly lean-to, over what had been the altar. The
space was strewn with brasses, fragments of fretted
and carven doors, and splintered beneath a mass of
tiling lay a great image of Kwan-on. The daylight
came dimly in through the chinks in the ruin. The
air was warm and close and had a smell of pulverized
plaster, of stale incense and rotting wood. A
group of priests stood on the altar platform beside
a huddle of wadded mats and brocaded draperies, on
which a man was lying, his open eyes upturned to
the painted monsters on the twisted tangle of rafters.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bishop hesitated, then came close.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The man's head turned toward him�for an instant
he seemed to shrink into the cushions; then in
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page367" id="page367" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;367]</span>
his eyes, dark with the last shadow, came a swift
yearning. He spoke to the priests and they drew
back.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Arthur," he said, "don't you know me?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A gasping sound came from the leaning bishop.
"John! John Fairfax!" he cried, composure dropping
from him, and fell on his knees. "After
these years!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other lifted his hand and touched the bishop's
pale, smooth-shaven face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am going, Arthur," he said. "I never intended
to speak, though I've seen you often.... I
thought it was best. Did she�did my wife never
tell you?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Never a word, John! I have never known!"
cried the bishop, in a shaken voice.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was my fault. All mine! I�never believed
as she did, Arthur, and here in the East what was
breath and bread to her, to me came to seem all
mumbo-jumbo. I had had a hard life, and I wanted
comfort�for her. Then I found out about the gold-lacquer."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He paused to gather the strength that was fast
ebbing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I got the formula from a crazy priest, and I
began in a small way�the idol-making, I mean. I
had a shop at Saga. At first it was only for the
mandarins in the China trade, and ... no one
knew. But the lacquer grew famous, and within a
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page368" id="page368" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span>
year I was shipping to Rangoon and Thibet. I made
all sorts of praying-tackle. Then�then I quarreled
with my agent, and�he told my wife. She didn't
believe it, but one day ... he brought her to
where I was at work. I was modeling an Amida for
a temple in Nagasaki!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He threw an arm across his face and moaned.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"She left me that night. A ship was in the harbor.
I ... never saw her again. I never knew
I had a daughter till a week ago!... I never
knew!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a silence.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I have seen her. She must never guess, Arthur!
She thinks I ... died in Nagasaki. It's better
so. Promise me!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I promise, John," said the bishop. "I promise."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The bell of the temple across the inclosure began
to strike. "It sounds ... like the bell of the
old Greek church," the failing voice said. "When I
left home the priest said I would do nothing good.
But�" the grim ghost of a smile touched his lips�"I
made ... good idols, Arthur!" The smile
flickered out. "My little girl! My own, own
daughter! Don't you ... think it was cruel,
Arthur?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Would you like to see her?" asked the bishop.
"She is just outside."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The wan face was illumined. "Yes, yes," he said.
"God bless you, Arthur! Bring her�but quickly!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page369" id="page369" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;369]</span>
For a few moments there was stillness. The
priests whispered together, but approached no
nearer. In the other temple, the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Bioki-Fuji</i>, the
Buddhist ceremony of Sick-Healing, had begun for
the injured man, and the muffled pounding of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">mok'gyo</i> came dully into the propped ruins. The
dying man's eyes were closed when Barbara knelt
down and took his chilling hand between hers.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It is I," she said softly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His gaze was dimming, but he knew her. "I can't
see your face much longer," he said, "but I can feel
your hands. How long ago it seems ... our
Flower-of-Dream. It bloomed to-day, my dear."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was weeping silently. There was a pause, in
which the wind droned through the shattered timbers.
The dying man's free hand wandered feebly
at his side, found a gold-lacquer crucifix, and drew
it closer.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The white cross on the roof. It ... called
me back!" He tried to lift the golden crucifix. "I've
been ... making this for a long time. I was
outside when the shock came, but I ... went
back to save it.... I should like it to be ...
in your Chapel, Barbara."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She laid her young cheek against his hand; she
could not speak.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Across the silence the bishop's low and broken
voice rose in the Prayer for the Sick:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">O most merciful God, who, according to the</i>
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page370" id="page370" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span>
<i style="text-shadow: none;">multitude of Thy mercies, dost so put away the sins
of those who truly repent, that Thou rememberest
them no more: Open Thine eye of mercy....
Renew in him, most loving Father.... Impute
not unto him his former sins....</i>"</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Are you still there, Barbara?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"A little longer." Death was heavy on his tongue.
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Namu Amida Butsu!</i>" he muttered. "But at the
end�the old things�the old faith�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The tears ran down the bishop's face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"They are all dead now," came the broken whisper
through the closing darkness. "There is no one
to forgive me, except�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"God will forgive you!" said the bishop, with
a sob.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But the idol-maker did not hear.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page371" id="page371" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;371]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLVII" id="chXLVII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLVII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">"IF THIS BE FORGETTING"</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">The</span> sailing-master of the yacht <i style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</i>, with
his mate and crony, sat in the main saloon,
whiling away a tedious hour.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The room bore all the earmarks of "a rich man's
plaything." It was tastefully and luxuriously furnished.
The upholstery was of dark green brocade,
thin Persian prayer-rugs were on the hardwood
floor, and electric bulbs in clusters were set in silver
sconces, which swung with a long, slow motion as
the yacht rocked to the deepening respiration of the
sea. At one side a small square table held the
remains of a comfortable refection, and by it, on a
stand, sat a phonograph with which the two men
had been gloomily diverting themselves.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But though the <i style="text-shadow: none;">repertoire</i> of the instrument was
extended, it had brought little satisfaction to-night.
The last irksome fortnight of inactivity had made
each selection trite and familiar. Moreover, the
captain's spirits were not of the best. The abrupt
change of ownership, followed hard by the death of
the yacht's former master, was a <i style="text-shadow: none;">bouleversement</i>
that had confused his automatic temperament, and
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page372" id="page372" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;372]</span>
the sight of the double-locked cabin-door in the
saloon was a daily depressant. He had never seen
the yacht's new owner, though she had written him
that he might expect her at any time, and the enigma
of a future under a woman's orders troubled his
sturdy and unimaginative mind.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Wish to the Lord she'd come, if she's ever coming!"
he muttered, as the phonograph ran down with
a wheeze. "This is two days I've kept the dinghy
lying at the <i style="text-shadow: none;">hatoba</i>."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The mate nodded. It was not the first time the
remark had been made. "I wonder why she ordered
his cabin door kept locked?" he said.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Papers," returned the captain sapiently. "Wants
to seal 'em up for the executor. New owner must
be rich, I guess. I'd like to know what she paid for
the outfit. First time I ever signed under a new
skipper sight unseen!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Miss Barbara Fairfax," mused the mate. "Nice
name. Curious only one piece of mail should come
for her�and second class, too." He picked up a
thin package from the table, folded in dark paper.
This had been made sodden by the rain; now it
parted and a flat, black disk of hard rubber slipped
from it and rolled across the floor.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Blamed if it isn't a phonograph record," he said,
as he picked it up. "It's out of the wrapper now�let's
try it." He set it in place and rewound the
spring, and the saloon filled with a chorus of chirps
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page373" id="page373" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;373]</span>
and tinklings from quivering catgut smitten by
ivory plectrons.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Samisen!</i>" said the captain. "I've heard 'em in
the tea-houses. Give me a fiddle for mine, any
day."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The yacht's cabin-boy entered. "The dinghy's
coming, sir," he said. "Lady and gentleman aboard
of her."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The captain got up hastily, put out a hand and
stopped the machine. "Take away those dishes, and
be quick about it," he ordered. "Mr. Rogers, pipe
up the men."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He hurried on deck and watched the bobbing craft
approach. Under the rising wind the sea was lifting
rapidly and the dinghy buried its nose in the spray.
Presently he was giving a helping hand to the visitors
at the break in the rail, looking into a pair of
brown eyes that he thought were the saddest he had
ever seen, and replying to a voice that was saying:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I am Miss Fairfax, Captain Hart, and this is my
uncle, Bishop Randolph."</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The train which brought Barbara and the bishop
from Tokyo had crawled for miles along what
seemed a narrow ribbon laid on a yellow floor.
The steady, continuous downpour had flooded the
rice-fields and the landscape was a waste of turbid
freshet, the rivers deep and swollen torrents. At
one bridge a small army of workmen were dumping
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page374" id="page374" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;374]</span>
loads of stone about a pier-head and shoring-up the
track with heavy timbers. The train crossed this at
a snail's pace, that inspired anxiety.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I'm not an engineer," the bishop had said, "but
I prophesy this bridge won't be safe to-morrow unless
the water falls."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The early daylight dinner at the hotel had been
well nigh a silent ceremonial. That day, with the
temple solitary, Barbara had gone down into a
deeper Valley of Shadow. Just as her longing to
go to him in her trouble had seemed to her overwrought,
so now her grief was strangely poignant.
When she thought of him her mind was a confusion
of tremulous half-thoughts and new emotions. She
could not know that the voice she dimly heard was
the call of blood�that she was in the grip of that
mighty instinct of filiation which strengthens the
life-currents of the world. Her grief�mysterious
because its springs were haunting and unknown�added
its aching pang now to the misery that had
encompassed her. She had felt the fierce bounding
of the stout little boat, the gusts of windy spray that
flew over them, with a tinge of relief, since the
buffeting made the inner pain less keen.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she stood at length, with her task, in the cabin
whose door had been so long locked, she remembered
the white-robed priests of Kudan Hill, stalking
barefooted across the hot coals. Her soul, she
thought, must tread a fiery path on which rested no
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page375" id="page375" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;375]</span>
miracle of painlessness, and which had no end.
Above her she could hear the irregular footfalls of
the bishop on the tilting deck, and the shrill humming
of the wind in the ventilators. It seemed to
be mocking her. Before the world she was living a
painful pretense. Even her uncle believed her to be
grieving for the man whose life had gone out that
night at Nikko!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When all had been done and the papers sealed in
a portmanteau for delivery to the Consul-General,
Barbara came into the brilliant saloon. The yacht
was pitching heavily and she could stand with difficulty.
Steadying herself against the table, she saw
the empty wrapper addressed to herself. It bore a
Nikko postmark. Who could have sent it here? As
she stood holding the paper in her hand, the bishop
entered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Captain Hart thinks we would better stay aboard
to-night, Barbara," he said. "There is a nasty sea
and we should be sure of a drenching in the dinghy.
We have no change of clothing, you know."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You will be quite comfortable, Miss Fairfax,"
the captain's voice spoke deferentially from the doorway.
"The guest-rooms are always kept ready."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Very well," she said, a little wearily. "That will
be best, no doubt." She held up the torn wrapper.
"What was in this, I wonder?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The captain confessed his indiscretion with embarrassment,
and she absolved him with a smile that
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page376" id="page376" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
covered a sharper pang than she had yet felt that
evening. For that thin disk had been on the hillside
that Nikko night�perhaps had heard that quarrel,
had seen that blow, had watched a man crawling,
staggering foot by foot, till he collapsed against the
frame that held it! By what strange chance had it
been sent to her here?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her uncle bade her good night presently, being
an indifferent sailor, and betook himself to bed. The
room that had been prepared for her opened into the
saloon. She was too restless to retire, and after a
time she climbed up the companion-way to the
windy deck.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The vaulted sapphire of the sky had been swept
clean of cloud and the stars sparkled whitely. Off
at one side, a flock of sinister shadows, she could
make out the Squadron of battle-ships, and beyond,
in a curving line, the twinkling lights of the Bund.
Could it ever again be to her that magical shore she
had first seen from a ship's deck, with hills which
the cherry-trees made fairy tapestries of green-rose,
and mountains creased of purple velvet and veined
with gold? The great white phantom lifting above
them�would it henceforth be but a bulk of ice and
stone, no longer the shrine of the Goddess-of-Radiant-Flower-Bloom?
The sky�would it ever
again seem the same violet arch that had bent over a
Tokyo garden of musk flowers and moonlight?
Would the world never seem beautiful to her again?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page377" id="page377" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span>
All about her the foam-stippled water glowed with
points of phosphorescence, as though a thousand
ghostly lanterns were afloat. It made her think of
the festival of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Bon</i>, of which Thorn had told her,
when the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shoryo-bun�</i>�the boats of the departed
spirits�in lambent flotillas, go glimpsing down to
the sea. How unbelievable that she should never
see him again! She felt a sudden envy of the placid
millions encircling her to whose faith no life was
ever lost, whose loved ones were ever coming back
in the perennial cherry-blooms, the maple-leaves, the
whispering pines.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Her love would come back to her only in bitter
memories, in painful thoughts that would shame and
burn. All else beside, she had been Austen Ware's
promised wife. How could she still feel love for
the man who had caused his death? Yet�if she
must�if she could never tear that image from her
breast!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Like the reflection of a camera-obscura, memory
painted a sudden picture on the void; she saw herself
sitting amid the branches of a tulip-tree, while
some one sang�a song the wind was humming in
the cordage:</p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLVIII" id="chXLVIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLVIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">WHILE THE CITY SLEPT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt</span> accompanied his chief that evening
to a dinner at the Nobles' Club�a "stag,"
for conventional functions had been discontinued
since the royal death had cast a pall over the
stay of the Squadron. As they drove thither a
nearer shadow was over the Ambassador's spirits.
His thoughts would stray to Barbara and her misfortune,
which seemed so deep and irreparable. He
had eventually accepted his wife's diagnosis as to
Daunt's <i style="text-shadow: none;">tendresse</i>, but he had a confidence that his
Secretary of Embassy, though hard-hit, would bear
no scars. He could not guess all that lay beneath
the brave domino Daunt was wearing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The affair was a late one, with various native
divertisements: top-spinners, painters whose exquisite
brush-etchings, done in a few seconds, were
given as mementoes to the guests, and jugglers who,
utterly without paraphernalia, caused live fowl to
appear in impossible places. Toward the close the
Ambassador found himself seated beside the Minister
of Marine.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Very clever," he said, as a Chinese pheasant flew
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page380" id="page380" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;380]</span>
out of an inverted opera-hat. "I almost believe he
could produce my missing dog if he were properly
urged."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Have you lost one?" asked the Admiral. "I'm
sorry."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador laughed. "It was really something
of a relief," he said, and told the story of the
Russian wolf-hound which had so curiously disappeared
on the evening of Doctor Bersonin's call.
"The oddest thing about it," he ended, "is that,
though the name of the Embassy was on his collar,
nothing has been heard of him."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The two men chatted for some time on things in
general, the conversation veering to the Squadron.
The Ambassador thought the other seemed somewhat
distrait. At two the affair ended and the carriages
drew up to the windy porte-coch�re. There
was a confidential matter which the Ambassador
wished to speak of with his host. He had mentioned
it, but no fitting opportunity had occurred. At the
door the Admiral recalled it, suggesting with a quizzical
reference to the other's American fondness for
late hours that, as his house was on the way, the Ambassador
stop there, while they had their talk over a
cigar. The latter, therefore, departed in the Admiral's
carriage, and Daunt drove alone to the Embassy,
directing the coachman to go in a half-hour
for his chief.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the past three days Daunt had fought a constant
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page381" id="page381" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
battle. Every feature of that night at Nikko
was stamped indelibly on his mind. The passionate
resentment, the agony of protest that had come to
him at the ball, when he had received the torn fragments
of his letter to Barbara, returned in double
force, opposing a strange, new sense of shame that
his thought should follow her even into the tragic
shadow where she now dwelt. Yet�for fancy will
not be denied�his brain would again and again
circle the same somber treadmill:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">We have done those things which we ought not to
have done!</i> He seemed to hear her say it on the
dark hillside. Her voice had had that in it which,
against his will, had thrilled him. What had she
done that she regretted? She had spoken of the day
in the cave at Enoshima�had seemed to wish him
to believe that she had not then been acting a part.
Could anything have happened in that one day's interval
so utterly to change her? She had been
unhappy, for he had surprised her weeping. What
was it she had wished to "confess?" So to-night
his gloomy reflections ran�to their submerging
wave of self-reproach.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He let himself into the Chancery with his latch-key,
to get his evening's mail. A telegram had been
laid on his desk. It was a cipher from Washington,
and he opened the safe at once and from the inner
drawer took out the official code books. He sat
down at one of the desks and began the decoding of
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page382" id="page382" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;382]</span>
the text. For a time he worked mechanically�as it
were, with but one-half of his brain�tracing each
group of figures in the bulky volume, transposing by
the secret key, dragging, in the complicated process,
sense and coherency from the meaningless digits.
Then he sat staring at the result:</p>

<blockquote style="text-shadow: none;">
<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Large short selling to-day in European
bourses and in New York (comma) unexplainable
on usual grounds (comma) is creating
anxiety (period) Can scarcely be
explained except on hypothesis that secret
group of dealers have suddenly come into
possession of information which leads them
to consider the international situation ominous
(period) Newspapers in ignorance
of anything extraordinary (period) London
and Paris evidently puzzled (period)
Has situation developed new phases and in
your opinion does it contain possible element
of danger (period) Hasten reply."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A full five minutes Daunt sat motionless, revolving
the matter in all its bearings. An answer must
be sent without delay. A part of that answer might
be found in the departure of the Squadron. The
newspapers had announced its receipt of sailing-orders,
but the news had yet to be verified. The
Naval Minister could give this verification.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He went at once to the stables, where the carriage
was about to start for the Ambassador. He sprang
in. A little later he was at the Admiral's official
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page383" id="page383" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;383]</span>
residence and his chief was perusing the message.
After a moment's thought the Ambassador read it
aloud.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt had made a move to retire, but the Admiral
stopped him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pray don't go yet," he said. "There is something
I should like to say on this matter, and I count
on your discretion, Mr. Daunt, as on His Excellency's.
Since the American Government attaches
significance to that peculiar incident, I think no
harm can come from an exchange of opinion. It
may help us both." He paused a moment, his foot
tapping the floor.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The news contained in that telegram," he continued
presently, "for the past two days has caused
my Government great concern. Your Excellency
will understand when I say that the particular objects
of this attack (if I may so call it) are precisely
those securities which would suffer most were
Japan's peace or prosperity threatened. There has
seemed to be a concurrence in it not purely fortuitous.
Back of this selling is no mere opinion�it is
too assured for that. Some interest or individual
abroad is apparently banking heavily on a belief that
Japan is about to enter a period of stress!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador spoke for the first time.
"<i style="text-shadow: none;">Abroad?</i>" he said shrewdly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Admiral looked at him an instant without
speaking. His expression changed swiftly. He
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page384" id="page384" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;384]</span>
rose and went quickly to the telephone in the next
room.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"He is talking with the Secret Service," said
Daunt, in a low tone.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In a few moments their host returned. There was
something in his face that made the Ambassador's
keen eye kindle. "The suggestion was most pertinent,"
he said. "There is one man in Japan who,
exclusive of the commercial codes, has sent in the
past two days cipher telegrams to New York, London
and Berlin."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He took a short turn about the room in some
agitation. "Your Excellency," he said, stopping
short, "I make a confident of you. That man is
Doctor Bersonin."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador started.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Pray absolve me," said the Admiral quickly,
"from an apparent indiscretion. Doctor Bersonin
is no longer in the Japanese service. His contract
expired at noon to-day. It will not be renewed. As
one of <i style="text-shadow: none;">my</i> Government I speak to you, as the representative
of <i style="text-shadow: none;">your</i> Government, concerning a private
individual whose acts are in the purview of us both.
The circumstances are extraordinary, but I think
the occasion justifies this conversation."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He rang a bell sharply and his private secretary
entered. "Bring me," he said in Japanese, "report
number eleven of Lieutenant Ishida Hetaro."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When it was brought, he turned to a leaf underscored
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page385" id="page385" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;385]</span>
scored with red. "Your Excellency," he said, "interested
me profoundly this evening by the account
of the disappearance of your dog. I am going to
ask Mr. Daunt�who reads Japanese so fluently�to
give a running translation of this."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt took the manuscript�as perfectly executed
as an inscription in Uncial Greek�and began to
read. As he translated, his breath came more
quickly, and the Ambassador leaned forward across
the table. Yet the words chronicled nothing more
than the curious disappearance from the laboratory
of a tiny song-bird�<i style="text-shadow: none;">and a steel pen-rest</i>. The close
of the narrative drew an exclamation from the Ambassador's
lips. For it told of feathery sprays of
reddish-brown powder on the expert's desk, and he
seemed to see himself, his study lamp in his hand,
bending over curious whorls of dust on his own
piazza.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"May I ask," said the Admiral, "whether the episode
of the dog suggested to Your Excellency the
possibility that your caller might himself be able to
solve the mystery of the animal's disappearance?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Ambassador's reply came slowly, but with
deliberate emphasis:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It did. The more so, from our previous conversation.
In my study I have the model of a Dreadnaught.
We were discussing this, and the doctor
described the fighting machine of the future�an
atomic engine which should utilize some newly discovered
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page386" id="page386" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;386]</span>
law of molecular action, a machine that
might be carried in a single hand, to which a battle-ship
would be, as he expressed it, 'mere silly shreds
of steel.' He spoke, I thought, with a strange confidence
that seemed almost unbalanced. In connection
with the conversation, the later incident, I
confess, left a deep impression. Yet the idea it suggested
was so incredible that I have never spoken
of it to any one before."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Suppose," said the Admiral, "that the man we
are discussing has actually constructed such a
machine. What possible connection can there be
between that and a confidence in some near event
which will lower Japan's credit in the eyes of the
world?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Before the Ambassador replied there was the
sound of voices outside�a sudden commotion and
a woman's agitated protestations. The secretary
came in hurriedly and whispered to the Admiral.
A door slammed in the hall, there was the sound of
a short struggle, and a girl burst into the room.
She threw herself at the Admiral's feet, panting
broken sentences. Her <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> was torn and muddied,
her blue-black hair was loosened, and her face
white and pitifully working.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A man had darted after her�he was the Admiral's
<i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i>. He grasped her arm. "She has been
at the Department," he said in English, with a
glance at the visitors. "They detained her there,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page387" id="page387" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;387]</span>
but she got away. They have telephoned a warning
that she might attempt to see you."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She struggled against him, her eyes sweeping the
circle about her with a passionate entreaty. Suddenly
she saw the Ambassador. She lifted her face,
swollen with crying, to him:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"You�nod know me�Haru?" she faltered, "<i style="text-shadow: none;">n�</i>?
Say so!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Haru!" he exclaimed. Then, turning to the
Admiral, "I know the child," he said. "She was
companion to one of our house-guests till a week
ago, when she disappeared from her home."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His host made an exclamation of pity. "It is
<i style="text-shadow: none;">no-byo</i>, no doubt," he said, using the word for the
strange Japanese brain-fever which is akin to madness.
"She must be cared for at once." He leaned
and spoke soothingly to her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A spasm seized Haru. She tore herself from the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">aide's</i> grasp and, falling prone, beat her small fists
on the floor. "They will none of them listen! They
will none of them listen!" she screamed, in Japanese.
"They call it the fever, and they will not hear! And
to-morrow it will be too late!" A peal of hysteric
laughter shook her, mixed with strangling sobs.
"Are all the gods with Bersonin-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i>?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At that name the Admiral's face changed swiftly.
"Leave her with me," he said, "and wait in the anteroom."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But, Excellency�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page388" id="page388" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;388]</span>
The other lifted his hand, and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> withdrew
with the secretary. His two callers had risen, but
he stayed them. "We have gone far along the road
of confidence to-night," he said in a low tone. "If
you are willing, we will go to the end."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He bent and drew the girl to a sitting posture.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Tell us," he said gently, "what brought you
here."</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page389" id="page389" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;389]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chXLIX" id="chXLIX" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER XLIX<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE ALARM</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">As</span> the three men listened to the swift, broken
story, there was no sound save the rustle of
the wind outside, the clack of a night-watchman,
and the ticking of the clock on the marble mantel.
The crouching form, the sodden garments, the
passionate intensity of the slim, clutched hands, the
fire in the dark eyes�all lent effect to a narrative instinct
with terrible truth. The Ambassador's knowledge
of the colloquial was limited, but he knew
enough to grasp the story's main features. It capped
the edifice of suspicion and furnished a direful solution
to what had been mysterious. Once the Admiral's
eyes met his, and each knew that the other
<i style="text-shadow: none;">believed</i>. Terrible as its meaning was�pointing to
what black depths of abysmal wickedness�it was
true!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Admiral listened with a countenance that
might have been carved of metal, but the faces of
the others were gray-white. Later was to come to
both the pathos and meaning of the sacrifice this
frail girl had laid on the knees of her country's gods,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page390" id="page390" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;390]</span>
but for the hour, all else was swallowed up in the
horrifying knowledge, struck through with the
sharp fact that one of the partners in this devilish
enterprise, however expatriate, was of their own nation.
To Daunt this was intensified by his own
acquaintance with Phil. Memories swept him of
that worthless, ribald career�the evil intimacy with
Bersonin�the gradual dominance of the bottle,
which in the end had betrayed him!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a singular separateness of vision, he seemed,
in lightning-like flashes, to see that betrayal: the
blind infatuation, the slow enticements, the reckless,
intoxicated triumph, the final surrender. He
seemed to see Haru, her secret won, running panting
through the wind. He saw Phil waking at last
from his drunken slumber�to what shame and penalty?
He shuddered.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">When the secretary entered at the crisp sound of
the Admiral's bell, he started at the pallid countenances
in the room. The Japanese girl stood trembling,
half-supported by the Admiral's arm. The
latter spoke�in a voice that held no sign of feeling.
It was to present the young man to the girl in the
most formal and elaborate courtesy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The <i style="text-shadow: none;">Ojo-San</i> deigns to be for but an hour the
guest of my mean abode," he said. "Instruct my
<i style="text-shadow: none;">karei</i> that in that unworthy interval he may offer
her august refreshment and afterward prepare her
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page391" id="page391" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;391]</span>
proper escort and conveyance. Meantime, send my
<i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> to me."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The secretary's gleam of astonishment veiled itself
under oriental lashes, and a tinge of color
warmed the whiteness of Haru's cheek. He bowed
to her profoundly. As he deferentially opened the
door, she turned back, swayed, and sank suddenly
prone in a deep, sweeping obeisance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">An instant the Admiral stood looking after her.
"The petal of a plum-blossom," he said, "under the
hoof of the swine!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His manner changed abruptly as the <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> entered.
He spoke in quick, curt Japanese, in a tone sharp
and exact as steel shears snipping through zinc:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Something has transpired of great moment.
There is no time to deal with it by the ordinary channels.
It is of the first importance�the <i style="text-shadow: none;">first</i> importance!�that
I reach Yokohama within the hour.
You will call up Shimbashi and order a special train
with right of way. This admits of <i style="text-shadow: none;">no delay</i>! Send
for my carriage at once. You will accompany me.
We leave in ten minutes." The <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> went out
quickly while he seated himself at his desk and began
to write rapidly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Two battle-ships!" he said suddenly, wheeling
in his seat. "With the human lives on them!
Perhaps even war between two or more nations!
Gods of my ancestors! All this to hang on the
loyalty of a mere girl!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page392" id="page392" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;392]</span>
The Ambassador, pacing the floor, snapped the
lid of his watch. "It must still be close to two hours
of sunrise," he said in an agitated voice. "Surely
there is time!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Admiral was consulting an almanac when the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> re�ntered. "Here is a telegram," he said. "Put
it on the wire at once. It must arrive before us."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Excellency," said the <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i>, "the train is not possible.
The service to Yokohama ceased at six
o'clock. The rains�there is a washout."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His chief pondered swiftly. "It must be left to
others, then. Call up the emergency long-distance
for Yokohama and give me a clear wire at once to
the Governor's residence. I must make the telegraphic
instructions fuller." He bent over the desk.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Trepidation was on the <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide's</i> face when he returned
this time.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Excellency the accident to the line was the failure
of the bridge over the Rokuga-gawa. It carried
both the telegraph and telephone conduits. No wire
will be working before noon to-morrow."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Admiral half-rose. He stretched out his
hand, then drew it back.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The wireless!" exclaimed the Ambassador.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide's</i> troubled voice replied. Whatever the
necessity he knew that it was a crucial one.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The mast was displaced by to-day's earthquake,"
he said. "The system is temporarily useless."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page393" id="page393" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;393]</span>
There was a moment of blank silence. The Admiral
sat staring straight before him. The only
sign of agitation was his labored breathing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Can a horse get through?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other shook his head. "Not under three
hours. It would have to be by <i style="text-shadow: none;">d�tour</i>�and there
are no relays."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"A motor car?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Impossible!" exclaimed the Ambassador. "By
the long road and in better weather my Mercedes
can not do it under eighty minutes."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Admiral lifted himself from his chair. His
eyes were bloodshot and on his forehead tiny veins
had sprung out in branching clusters of purple.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"In the name of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shaka</i>! Yokohama harbor but a
handful of miles away, and cut off utterly? It must
be reached, I tell you! <i style="text-shadow: none;">It must be reached!</i>" His
voice was low-pitched, but terrible in its intensity.
"Drive to the Naval College and ask for twenty
cadets�its swiftest runners�to be sent after you to
Shimbashi. A locomotive can take them as far as
the river. If there are no <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>, they can swim.
Make demand in my authority. Not a minute is to
be lost!" He put what he had been writing into the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">aide's</i> hand. "Read this in the carriage. It will
serve as instruction."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The <i style="text-shadow: none;">aide</i> thrust the paper into his breast and vanished.
The Admiral looked about him through stiffened,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page394" id="page394" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;394]</span>
half-closed eyelids. Then, under the stress,
it seemed, of a mighty shudder�the very soul of
that overwhelming <i style="text-shadow: none;">certainty</i> of the peril awaiting the
red dawn on that bungalow roof above the Yokohama
anchorage�the racial impassivity, the restraint
and repression of emotion that long generations
of ingrain habit have made second nature to
the Japanese, suddenly crumbled. He struck his
hand hard against the desk.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Has not Japan toiled and borne enough, that this
shame must come to her?" His deep voice shook.
"Your Excellency�Mr. Daunt�in all this land
where heroism is hackneyed and sacrifice a fetish,
there is no prince or coolie who, to turn aside this
peril, would not give his body to the torture. Yet
must we sit here helpless as <i style="text-shadow: none;">Darumas</i>! If man but
had wings!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt stiffened. He felt his heart beat to his
temples. He started to his feet with an exclamation.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"But man <i style="text-shadow: none;">has</i> wings!" he cried.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">What of the long hours of toil and experiment,
the gray mornings on Aoyama parade-ground when
his Glider had carried him circling above the tree-tops?
Could he do it? With no other word he
darted to the hall. They heard his flying feet on the
gravel and a quick command to a <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i>. The wind
tossed back the word into the strained quiet.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page395" id="page395" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;395]</span>
"Aoyama!" exclaimed the Ambassador, as the
hoof-beats, lashed to an anguish of speed, died into
silence. "His Glider!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A sudden hope flashed into the Admiral's face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The gods of <i style="text-shadow: none;">Nippon</i> aid him!" he said.</p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">WHOM THE GODS DESTROY</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">There</span> was one whose guilty eyes were closed
to the red danger so near. In the house in
the Street-of-the-Misty-Valley, under the
green mosquito netting, Phil lay in a log-like slumber.
The soft light of the paper <i style="text-shadow: none;">andon</i> flowed over
the gay wadded <i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>, the handsome besotted face
with its mark of the satyr and, at one side, a little
wooden pillow of black lacquer. There was no
sound save the sweep of the wind outside and the
heavy breathing of the unconscious man.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For three nights past, since his wild motor-ride
from Nikko, he had not slept, save in illusory
snatches, from which he had waked with the sweat
breaking on his forehead. Short as were these, they
had held horrid visions, broken fragments of scenes
that waved and clustered about the lilied altar in
the Ts'kiji cathedral, echoing to the solemn service
of the dead. Again and again there had started before
him the stolid ring of blue-clad coolie women,
swaying as they had swayed to the straw-ropes of
the pile-driver in the moat-bottom with their weird
chant�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page397" id="page397" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;397]</span></p>

<div class="poem" style="text-shadow: none;">
<div class="stanza" style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">"Y��eeya�k��ra!</i></span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
<span class="i0" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">Y��eeya�k��ra!"</i></span><br style="text-shadow: none;">
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And now they chanted a terrible refrain:</p>

<p class="center" style="text-shadow: none;"><i style="text-shadow: none;">"Thou�shalt�not�kill!"</i></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">To-night, however, deeper potations had done
their work. He was dreaming�yellow dreams like
the blackguard fancyings of the half-world�visions
in which he moved, a Prince of Largesse, through
unending pleasures of self-indulgence. He was on
an European Boulevard, riding with Haru by his
side in silk and pearls, and people turned to gaze as
he went by.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">But now, with sinister topsyturvydom, the dream
changed. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">cocher</i> drove faster and faster, into a
mad gallop. He turned his head and Phil saw that
the face under the glazed hat was the face of his
dead brother. The staring pedestrians began to pursue
the carriage. They showered blow after blow
on it, till the sound reverberated like thunder.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Not the ghosts of his dream, but a hand of flesh
and blood was knocking. It was on the outer <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>
and the frail dwelling shook beneath it. The servant,
sunk in bovine sleep, heard no sound, but the
chauffeur in the automobile that throbbed outside the
wistaria gate, rose from his seat, and across a bamboo
wattle a dog barked and scrambled venomously.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's eyes opened and he sat up giddily. He
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page398" id="page398" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;398]</span>
went unsteadily to the door and unfastened the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>,
blinking at the great form that strode past him into
the inner apartment.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin's gaze swept the room. "The girl!" he
said hoarsely. "Where is she?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil looked about him dazedly�at the tumbled
<i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i>, the deserted wooden pillow. Haru gone? His
senses, clouded by intoxication, took in the fact
dully, as a thing of no meaning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The expert grasped him by his shoulder and shook
him till the thin silk of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> tore under the
enormous white fingers. The violence had its effect.
The daze fell away. Phil broke into loud imprecations.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Did you tell her anything?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's tongue clove to the roof of his mouth.
"What is�what makes you think�" he stammered.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin's face was a greenish hue. His great
hands shook.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"To-night," he said, in a whisper, "to-night�an
hour ago�I saw her on the street. I wasn't sure at
first, but I know now it was she! A naval officer was
with her. <i style="text-shadow: none;">He took her into the house of the Minister
of Marine!</i>"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other gave a low cry. A chalky pallor overspread
his features. "Haru?�no, Bersonin! You're
crazy, I say. She�she would never tell!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Fury and terror blazed out on the big man's countenance.
A sharp moan came from his lips.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page399" id="page399" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;399]</span>
"So she <i style="text-shadow: none;">did</i> know! You told her then! O, incredible
fool!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For an instant the demon of murder looked from
the doctor's eyes. Phil quailed before him. A
frenzy of fear twisted his features; he felt the passion
that had been his undoing shrivel and fade like
a parchment in a flame. His voice rose in a kind of
scream:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Don't look at me like that!" he raved. "I was a
fool to trust her, but it's done now. It's done, I tell
you, and you can't undo it! What can they do to
us? They may find the machine, but what can they
<i style="text-shadow: none;">prove</i>? We're foreigners! They can't touch us without
proof!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He had no thought now of the millions that were
to have been his. All the grandiloquent pictures he
had painted of the future faded in panic. He trembled
excessively.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Proof!" sneered Bersonin savagely. "There
would have been none if�<i style="text-shadow: none;">it happened</i>! I had arranged
that! In its operation <i style="text-shadow: none;">the machine destroys
itself</i>! And neither of us is in Yokohama to-night."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil's ashen face set; his tongue curled round his
parched lips. "What is to be done? Can we still�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Listen," said the doctor. "A single hour more,
even with your cursed folly, and all would have been
well, for no trains are running and all wires are
down. I heard this afternoon, too, that the wireless
is out of order."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page400" id="page400" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;400]</span>
"Then�then�they can not�" Phil's voice shook
with a nauseous eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Wait! When I saw the girl there, I was suspicious.
I watched. In a little while your friend
Daunt came from the gate. In some way he happened
to be there. The <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i> was flogging the horses
like a crazy man. He came in this direction!�Can't
you understand? His a�roplane! He is going to use
it as a last chance. If he succeeds, we may spend our
lives in the copper mines. If he can be stopped, we
may win yet! There will be nothing but the tale of
a Japanese drab�that and nothing else!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Phil flung on his clothing in a madness of haste.
The desperate dread that had raged in him was become
now a single fixed idea, frosted over by a cold,
demented fury. Unhealthy spots of red sprang in
his white cheeks; his eyes dilated to the mania of
the paranoiac.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Hatless, he rushed through the little garden,
cleared the rear hedge at a bound, and fled, like a
runaway from hell, toward the darkness of the vast
parade-ground.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page401" id="page401" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;401]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chLI" id="chLI" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER LI<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE LAUGH</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">As</span> Bersonin stood by the wistaria gate beside
the pulsing motor, confused thoughts rushed
through his mind into an eddying phantasmagoria.
The fear and agitation which he had kept
under only by an immense self-control returned with
double weight.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">All was known�thanks to the brainless fool in
whom he had relied! The Government knew. The
wild tale the Japanese girl had told had been believed!
Had there been suspicions before? He
thought of the espionage he had fancied had been
kept of late on his movements, of the silent, saturnine
faces he had imagined dogged his footsteps. Even
his servants, even Ishida, with his blank visage and
fantastic English, might be�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He looked sharply at the chauffeur. He was lighting
a cigarette in the hollow of his hands; the ruddy
flare of the match lit the brown placid face, the narrow,
secret-keeping eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He tried to <i style="text-shadow: none;">force</i> his mind to a measure of control,
to look the situation in the face.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">If Phil failed. If the a�roplane won against darkness
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page402" id="page402" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;402]</span>
and wind�if the bungalow was reached in
time, and the machine made harmless. Nothing
would happen. Who, then, would believe the girl's
wild story? Who could show that he had made it?
He had worked at night, alone in his locked laboratory.
Besides, it would tell nothing. It would yield
its secret only to the master mind. And if its presence
on the roof damned anybody, it would not be
him! <i style="text-shadow: none;">He</i> had not put it there. <i style="text-shadow: none;">He had not been in
Yokohama in three days!</i></p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">If the a�roplane did not start�he remembered the
look on Phil's face when he rushed away!�or if it
failed. With its own deadly ray, the very machine
would vanish. Phil had not known this�could not
have told. The searchers would find nothing! The
news would have flashed along the cables that must
roll up for him vast sums in the panic of markets.
And there would be nothing to bring the deed home
to him!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Nothing? The warning had been given <i style="text-shadow: none;">before the
fact</i>. The Government had taken alarm. Bureaus
were buzzing already. Sooner or later the accusation
would be running through the street, swiftly
and stealthily, from noble to merchant, from coolie
to beggar, from end to end of this seething oriental
city�wherein he was a marked man! What mattered
it whether there were evidence on which a
court would condemn him? The story of his huge
<i style="text-shadow: none;">coup</i> in the bourses would be told�would rise up
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page403" id="page403" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;403]</span>
against him. He remembered suddenly a tale he
had heard�of a traitor to Japan cut to pieces in a
tea-house. An icy sweat broke out on his limbs.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Where was there any refuge? On a foreign ship?
There were many in the bay. He longed with a
desperate longing for the touch of a deck beneath his
feet, a bulwark of blue water between him and possible
vengeance. At Kisaraz' on the Chiba Road, a
dozen miles to the north in the curve of the bay, was
his summer villa, his frequent resort for week-end.
His naphtha launch lay there, always ready for use.
He could reach it in an hour.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Get into the tonneau," he said to the chauffeur.
"I'll drive, myself."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He took the wheel the other resigned, threw on
the clutch, and the clamorous monster moved off
down the quiet lane. Past ranks of darkened <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i>,
with here and there a barred yellow square; by lanterned
tea-houses, alight and tinkling, past stolid,
pacing watchmen in white duck clothing, and sauntering
groups of night-hawk students chanting
lugubrious songs�faster and faster, till the chauffeur
clutched the seat with uneasiness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The fever of flight was on his master now. He began
to imagine voices were calling after him. From
a police-box ahead a man stepped into the roadway
waving a hand. It was no more than a warning
against over-speed, but the gesture sent a thrill of
terror through the big man at the wheel. He
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page404" id="page404" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;404]</span>
swerved sharply around a corner, skidding on two
wheels.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin muttered a curse as he peered before him,
for the stretch was brilliantly illuminated. He was
on the Street-of-Prayer-to-the-Gods, which to-night
seemed strangely alive with hubbub.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">That afternoon, with the passing of the rain,
there had been held a neighborhood <i style="text-shadow: none;">hanami</i>, a
"flower-viewing-excursion." A score of families,
with picnic paraphernalia, had trooped to the wistaria
arbors of far-distant Kameido, to return in the
small hours laden with empty baskets and somnolent
babies. To-morrow, like to-day, would be holiday,
when school and work alike should be forgotten.
The cavalcade had just returned�afoot, since the
trams had ceased running at midnight�the men
merry with <i style="text-shadow: none;">sak�</i>, the women chattering. A few
children, still wakeful, scampered here and there.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The chauffeur leaned forward with an exclamation�they
had all but run down a hobbling figure.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Keep your hands off!" snarled Bersonin. "Let
them get out of the way!" The automobile dashed
on, the people scattering before it.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a small figure in the roadway, however,
of whom no one took account�a six year old.
Ishikichi had not gone to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">hanami</i> that day. For
many hours that long afternoon, while his mother
cared for the sick father, he had beat the tiny drum
that soothed a baby's fret, comforted by the promise
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page405" id="page405" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;405]</span>
that he should be waked in the great hour when the
crowd came home. Stretched on his worn <i style="text-shadow: none;">f'ton</i> that
night, he had puzzled over the situation�the hard,
blank fact that because they had no money, they
must give up the shop, which was the only home he
knew. When they took his father away to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">byo-in</i>,
the sick-house, what would he and his mother and
the baby-<i style="text-shadow: none;">San</i> do? Would they stand, like the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kadots'ke</i>, playing a <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> at people's doors? It
was not honorably pleasant to be a <i style="text-shadow: none;">kadots'ke</i>! Only
men could earn money, and it would be so long before
he became a man. So he had been pondering
when he went to sleep. Now, standing in the road,
he heard the hum of the rushing motor, and a quick
thought,�born of that instinct of sacrifice for the
parent, that is woven, a golden thread, in the woof of
the Japanese soul�darted into his baby brain. One
of the big fire-wagons of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">seiyo-jin</i> was coming!
When the carriage killed Toru, his playmate, the
foreigner had sent much money to Toru's house.
He was not sorry any more, because the white-faced
man whom he liked, who lived in the temple, had
told him what a fine thing it had been. For Toru's
honorable father had been fighting with the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Gaki</i>,
the no-rice-devils�it was almost like a war�and
Toru had died just as the brave soldiers did in battle.
A great purpose flooded the little soul. Was he
not brave, too?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">So, as Bersonin, with a snarl, shook off the hand
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page406" id="page406" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;406]</span>
of the chauffeur and threw the throttle wide open,
Ishikichi did not scamper with the rest. With his
hands tightly clenched in his patched <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, his
huge clogs clattering on the roadway, he ran straight
into the path of the hurtling mass of steel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a sudden, sickening jolt. The car
leaped forward, dragging something beneath it that
made no sound. The chauffeur hurled himself
across the seat on the gear, and the automobile
stopped with a grinding discord of screeching pistons.
A surge of people came around it�a wave
without outcry, but holding a hushed murmur like
the sea. <i style="text-shadow: none;">Shoji</i> were opening, doorways filling the
street with light. A man bent and drew something
gently from between the wheels.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a writhing oath the expert wrenched at the
clutch.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Go on!" he said savagely. "How dare you stop
without my orders?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Japanese made no reply, but the arms that
braced the wheel were rigid as steel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Bersonin sank back in his seat, his massive frame
quivering, his eyes glittering like flakes of mica. But
for this, in ten minutes he would have been clear of
the city, flying along the Chiba Road! What if he
were detained? He felt strange, chilly tendrils plucking
at his flesh, and a hundred fiery needles seemed
pricking through his brain.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Peering over his shoulder, with his horrible fear
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page407" id="page407" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;407]</span>
on him, he saw the crowd part to admit a woman
who, quite silently, but with haste, came forward
and knelt on the ground. There was no movement
from the crowd.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In a hush like that of death, the mother rose with
Ishikichi in her arms. The white, still face looked
pitifully small. One clog swayed from its thong
between the bare toes. The faded <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> was
stained with red. She spoke no word. There was no
tear on her face. But in the dreadful silence, she
turned slowly with her burden and looked steadily
at the twitching face in the car�looked and looked.
The chauffeur swung himself from the seat into the
crowd.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">An insane desire had been creeping stealthily on
Bersonin. He had felt it coming when he faced the
truth in Phil's cringing admission. The horrible
compulsion to laughter was on him. The damnable
man-hysteria had him by the throat. He fought
it desperately, as one fights a wild beast in the dark.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In vain.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His jaws opened. He laughed�a dreadful peal
of merriment that echoed up and down the latticed
street. And as he laughed, he knew that he raised a
peril nearer, more fearful even than that from which
he had been flying.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was an instant's shocked calm, like the silence
which follows the distant spurt of blue flame
from the muzzle of a Krupp gun. Then, like its answering
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page408" id="page408" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;408]</span>
detonation�in such a menacing roar as
might arise from the brink of an Inferno�the silence
of the quiet street burst into awful sound.</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Ten minutes later but a single lighted <i style="text-shadow: none;">shoji</i> glimmered
on the darkened thoroughfare. The roadway
was deserted save for a soldierly figure in policeman's
uniform who stood thoughtfully looking at a
huddle in the dim roadway�a mixture of wrenched
and battered iron and glass, in the midst of which
lay an inert, shapeless something that might have
been a bundle of old clothes fallen from a scavenger's
cart.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<small style="text-shadow: none;">THE VOICE IN THE DARK</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara</span> rested ill in her cabin bed that
night. Confused dreams troubled her, mingling
familiar thoughts in kaleidoscopic confusion,
dragging her from one tangle to another in
a wearying rapidity against which she struggled in
vain. One thing ran through them all�the gold-lacquer
Buddha that had stood on the Sendai chest in
her bedroom at the Embassy; only it seemed to be
also that lost image before which she had used to sit
as a child.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She had no feeling of awakening, but all at once
the visions were gone and she lay open-eyed, swinging
to the movement of the sea, feeling the night
to be very long. There came over her a creeping oppression�a
sense of terror of the night, of its hidden
mysteries and occult forces. The darkness
seemed to be holding some dreadful, stolid, lethargic
thing that sprawled from horizon to horizon.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A small, noiseless clock was hung beside the bed.
She could see its pale face in the light of the thick
ground-glass bulb that served as night-lamp. It was
nearly four o'clock.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page410" id="page410" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;410]</span>
She twisted back the tawny-brown surge of her
hair, rose, and dressed as hastily as she could in the
lurching space. Then she opened the door and
passed into the saloon. A roll of the yacht slammed
to the cabin door and left her in darkness. She felt
for the electric switch, but before she could find it,
another movement sent her reeling against a stand.
She threw out her arm to stay her fall and struck
something.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a clicking sound, a soft whir, and then
the music of <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> filled the dark room. She realized
that she had staggered against the phonograph
in the corner and that the shock had started its
mechanism. Wincing, she groped her way to a chair
and sat down trembling.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The music died away. There was a pause, a sharp
click, a curious confusion of sounds, and then husky
and filmy, <i style="text-shadow: none;">a human voice</i>:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Barbara!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She caught her hands to her throat, her blood
chilling to ice. It was the voice of Austen Ware,
speaking, it seemed to her, from the world beyond.
She crouched back, breathing fast and hard, while
the voice went on, in strange broken periods,
threaded by a whir and clamor that seemed the noise
of the wind outside.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"What is that I knocked over? It's buzzing and
wheels are turning in it�or is it the pain? Can't
you stop it, Barbara? No, I know you aren't here,
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page411" id="page411" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;411]</span>
really. I'm all alone ... I must be light-headed.
How stupid!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The strange truth came to her in a stab of realization.
What she heard was no supernatural voice. In
its fall that night the phonograph's spring had been
released and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i> record had registered also
the delirious muttering of the dying man. She felt
herself shuddering violently.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I can't go any farther.... You�you've
done it for me, Phil. It ... was the second
blow. It seemed to crash right through...."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's heart was beating to bursting. "Austen,
Austen," she whispered to herself, in an agony.
"Tell me! Was it <i style="text-shadow: none;">Phil</i>? You can't know what
you're saying!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"No one must know it. The law would ...
no, no! What good would it do now? He's a bad
egg, but I ... I was always proud of the
family name. Barbara! Remember, it <i style="text-shadow: none;">wasn't Phil</i>!
It <i style="text-shadow: none;">wasn't Phil</i>!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She fell on her knees, her hands clasping the arms
of the chair, thrilling to the truth beneath that pitiful
denial. Phil, not Daunt! The man she had loved
had no stain of blood on his soul! She sobbed
aloud. With the whir of the machinery there mixed
a grating, scratching discord, as though an automaton
had attempted to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"How ridiculous it seems to die like this! Only
this morning I was so near ... so near to
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page412" id="page412" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;412]</span>
what I wanted most. It was your losing the locket
that checkmated me. Why couldn't I have found it
instead of Phil?... Did I tell you I was there
that day, Barbara�behind the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shikiri</i>, when you
followed the Japanese girl into the house? I could
see just what you were thinking ... I would
never have told you the truth ... never."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With a faint cry Barbara dragged herself backward.
In the illusion, everything about her for the
instant vanished. The yacht's walls had rolled away.
She was on a gloomy hillside, and a stricken man
was speaking�confessing.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Again the ghastly attempt to laugh.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"A contemptible thing, wasn't it! I knew that.
I've ... I've felt it.... I never seemed
contemptible to myself before. But I should have
had you, and that ... would have repaid. It
was all coming my ... way. Then, just the
dropping of a locket, and ... Phil ...
and now, it's all over!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara felt herself engulfed in a wave of complex
emotions. She was torn with a great repugnance,
a greater joy, and a sense of acute pity that
overmastered them both. Then there rolled over
all the recollection that what she now listened to was
but a mechanical echo. The hillside faded, the walls
of the yacht came back.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"I never believed in much, and I'm going without
whining. Are you near, Barbara? Sometimes there
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page413" id="page413" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;413]</span>
are many people around me ... and then only
you. I ... I think I'm beginning to wander!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She was weeping now, unrestrained.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was a long pause, in which the whir of the
wheels rasped on. Then�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Is it your ... arms I feel, Barbara? Or
... is it...."</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">That was all. The wheels whirred on a little
longer, a click and�silence. Only the rush of the
wind outside and the passionate sobbing of the girl
who knelt in the dark room, her face buried in her
hand, her heart tossed on the cross-tides of anguish
and of joy.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A long time she knelt there. She was recalled by
a confusion on the deck above her�shouts and a
hastening of feet. She lifted her face. The dawn
had come�its pale, faint radiance sifted through
the heavy glass ports and dimly lit the room. The
shouts and running multiplied.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She sprang to her feet, opened the door and hurried
up the companion-way.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page414" id="page414" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;414]</span></p>

<h2 style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="chLIII" id="chLIII" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>CHAPTER LIII<br style="text-shadow: none;">
<small style="text-shadow: none;">A RACE WITH DAWN</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">In</span> that furious pace toward Aoyama, Daunt had
been consumed by one thought: that upon his
single effort hung the saving of human lives�the
covering of a shame to his own nation�the turning
away of a foul allegation from the repute of a
friendly Empire. He knew that minutes were valuable.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">On the long, dimly-lighted roadways where the
flying hoofs beat their furious tattoo, few carts were
astir, and the trolleys had not yet appeared on the
wider thoroughfares. The rain had washed the air
clean, the wind was dustless and sweet, and the
stars were palely bright. Once a policeman signaled
and the driver momentarily slackened speed�then
on as before. The horses were white with foam
when they reached the parade-ground. Here Daunt
leaped down and wrenched both lamps from the
carriage. "Go home," he said to the <i style="text-shadow: none;">betto</i>, and running
through a clump of trees, struck across the
waste.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Japanese stared after him mystified, then
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page415" id="page415" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;415]</span>
with a philosophic objurgation, turned and drove
the sweating horses home at a walk.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt ran to a low door in the long garage. The
key was on a ring in his pocket. He went in, locking
the door behind him. There were no electric lights�he
had been there heretofore only by day�and the
carriage lamps made only a subdued glimmer that
was reflected from the polished metal of the great
winged thing resting on its carrier. He threw off
his evening coat and set feverishly to work. After
its single trial the new fan-propeller had been unshipped
for a slight alteration, and the flanges had
not yet been reassembled. There were delicate adjustments
to be made, wire rigging to be tautened,
a score of minute tests before all could be safe and
sure. He worked swiftly and with concentration,
feeling his mind answering to the stress with an absolute
coolness.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">At length the last attachment was in place, the
final bolt sent home and one of the lamps lashed
close in the angle of the wind screen. He took his
place and the engine started its familiar double
rhythm: pst-pst�pst-pst�pst-pst, as the explosive
drop fell faster and faster. He leaned and broke the
clutch which held the big double doors of the building.
They swung open and he threw on the gear.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And suddenly, as the propeller began to spin, in
the instant the Glider started in its rush down the
guides, Daunt was aware that some one had darted
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page416" id="page416" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;416]</span>
through the doors. He had a flashing view of a
white, disheveled face, heard a cry behind him�then
the prow of the Glider tilted abruptly, the air
whistled past the screens, the great flat field sank
away, and he was throbbing steeply upward, against
the sweep of the wind.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt threw himself forward�the bubble in the
spirit-level clung to the top of its tube. Rapidly he
warped down the elevation-vanes till slowly, slowly,
the telltale bubble crept to the middle of the level.
What was the matter? The engine was working
well, yet there was a sense of heaviness, of sluggishness
that was unaccountable. He looked to either
side, before him, behind him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">His fingers tightened on the clutches. Just forward
of the whirling propeller he made out the figure
of a man, lying flat along the ribs of the Glider's
body, clutching the steel guys of the planes, looking
at him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a moment he stared motionless. It was this
extra weight that had sent the Glider reeling prow-up�had
made it unresponsive to control. The man
who clung there had aimed to prevent the flight!
Daunt leaned to let the full beam of the flaring lamp
go past him. A quick intuition had told him whose
were the eyes that had glittered across the throbbing
fabric; but the face he saw now was infuriate
with a new look that made him shiver. It was incarnate
with the daredevil of terror. Phil had been
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page417" id="page417" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;417]</span>
a drunkard; he was drunk now with the calculate
madness of overmastering fear. As he gazed, a
flitting, irrelevant memory crossed Daunt's mind,
of a day at college, years before, when by a personal
appeal, he had saved Phil from the disgrace of expulsion.
And now it was Phil�<i style="text-shadow: none;">Phil!</i>�clinging
there, with desperate, hooked fingers, struggling to
consummate a crime that must sink him for ever!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Pst-pst�pst-pst�pst-pst; on the Glider drove.
With a fierce effort, Daunt crushed down the sense
of unreality and swiftly weighed his position.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The other was directly in front of the propeller,
a perilous place. Only the guy-wire was in his reach.
Between them was a shuddering space. To land in
the darkness to rid the a�roplane of that incubus,
was impossible. He must go on. Could he win with
such a terrible handicap? He set his teeth. Tilting
the lateral vanes, he soared in a wide serpentine,
peering into the deep, resounding dark below.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Tokyo lay a vast network of tiny pin-pricks of
fire. He had never been so high before, had been
content to sweep the tree-tops. To the left a bearded
scimitar of light, merged by blackness, marked the
bay. Daunt swung parallel with this. Pst-pst�pst-pst�pst-pst.
The wind tore in gusts through
the structure, the planes vibrating, the guys humming
like the strings of a gigantic harp. His clothing
dragged at his body. He was too high; he
leaned over the mass of levers and the Glider slid
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page418" id="page418" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;418]</span>
down a long, steep descent, till in the starlight he
could see the blue-gray blur of roofs, the massed
shadows of little parks of trees. Now he was passing
the edge of the city�now below him was the
gloom of the rice-fields. A low sobbing sound came
in the wind; it was the bubbling chorus of the frogs,
and across it he heard the bark of a peasant's dog.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">To the right a dark hill loomed without warning,
with a dim congeries of red tea-houses. It was the
famous Ikegami, the shrine of the Buddhist saint
Ichiren, famed for its plum-gardens. It fell away
behind, and now, far off, a score of miles ahead,
grew up on the horizon a misty blotch of radiance.
Yokohama! He swerved, heading out across the
lagoon, straight as the bee flies for the shimmering
spot. Pst-pst�pst-pst�faster and faster spat the
tiny explosions. The Glider throbbed and sang like
a thing alive, and the hum of the propeller shrilled
into a scream.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Tokyo was far behind now, the pale glow ahead
rising and spreading. To the right he could see the
clumped lights of the villages along the railroad,
Kamata�Kawasaki�Tsurumi. He dropped still
lower, out of the lash of the wind.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly a flying missile struck the forward
plane, which resounded like a great drum. A drop
of something red fell on his bare hand and a feathered
body fell like a stone between his feet. A
dark carpet, dotted with foam, seemed to spring up
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page419" id="page419" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;419]</span>
out of the gulf. Daunt threw himself at the levers
and rammed them back. The Glider had almost
touched the sea�for a heartbreaking instant he
thought it could never rise. He heard the curl of the
waves, and a cry from behind him. Then, slowly,
slowly, breasting the blast, it came staggering up the
hill of air to safety.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sky was perceptibly lightening now. Daunt
realized it with a tightening of all his muscles. It
was the first tentative withdrawal of the forces of
the dark. Should he be in time? With his free hand
he loosened the coil of the grapnel. Suddenly the
chances seemed all against success. A feeling of
hopelessness caught him. He thought of the two
men he had left behind, waiting�waiting. What
message would come to them that morning?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The engine was doing its best, every fiber of tested
steel and canvas ringing and throbbing. But the
creeping pallor of the night grew apace. Kanagawa:�the
Glider swooped above it, left it behind. The
misty glow was all around now, lights pricked up
through the shadow. Yokohama was under his feet,
and ahead�the darker mass toward which he was
hurtling�was the Bluff.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Slowly, with painful anxiety, he swung the huge
float in to skirt the cliff's seaward edge. There was
the naval hospital with its flag-staff. There beyond,
was the familiar break in the rampart of
foliage�and there, flapping in the wind, was the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page420" id="page420" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;420]</span>
awning on the flat roof of the Roost. In the dawning
twilight, it seemed a monstrous, leprous lichen,
shuddering at the unholy thing it hid. Daunt threw
out the grapnel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He curved sharply in, aslant to the wind, flung
down his prow and swooped upon it. There was a
tearing, splintering complaint of canvas and bamboo;
the Glider seemed to stop, to tremble, then
leaped on. Turning his head, Daunt saw the awning
disappear like a collapsed kite. He caught a glimpse,
on the steep, ascending roadway of a handful of
naked men running staggeringly, one straggler far
behind. The thought flashed through his mind that
these were the cadets from the Naval College. But
they would be too late! The sun was coming too
swiftly. The sky was a tide of amethyst�the dawn
was very near! He came about in a wide loop that
took him out over the bay, making the turn with the
wind. For a fraction of a second he looked down�on
the Squadron of battle-ships, a geometrical
cluster of black blots from which straight wisps of
dark smoke spun like raveled yarn into the formless
obscurity. A shrill, mad laugh came from behind
him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Daunt was essaying a gigantic figure-of-light
whose waist was the flat bungalow roof. It was a
difficult evolution in still sunlight and over a level
ground. He had now the semi-darkness, and the
sucking down-drafts of the wind that made his
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page421" id="page421" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;421]</span>
flight, with its driving falls and recoveries, seem the
careless fury of a suicide. Yet never once did his
hand waver, never did that strange, tense coolness
desert him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As he swept back, like a stone in the sling of the
wind, he saw the thing he had come to destroy. It
had the appearance of a large camera, set on a
spidery tripod near the edge of the flat roof, its lens
pointing out over the anchorage. Landing was out
of the question; to slacken speed meant to fall. He
must strike the machine with the body of the Glider
or with the grapnel. To strike the roof instead
meant to be hurled headlong, mangled or dead, his
errand unaccomplished, down somewhere in that
medley of roofs and foliage. The chances that he
could do this seemed suddenly to fade to the vanishing
point. A wave of profound hopelessness chilled
his heart.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">With Phil's mad, derisive laughter ringing in his
ears, he dropped the Glider's stem and drove it
obliquely across. The grapnel bounded and clanged
along the tiling, missing the tripod by three feet.
On, in an upward staggering lunge, then round
once more, wearing into the wind.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There was no peal of laughter now from the man
clinging to the steel rib. With the clarity of the
lunatic Phil saw how close the swoop had been.
The scourge of the wind and the rapid flight
through the rarefied air had exalted him to a cunning
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page422" id="page422" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;422]</span>
frenzy. He had no terror of the moment�all
his fear centered in the to-morrow. To his deranged
imagination the black square on the tripod
represented his safety. He had forgotten why.
But Bersonin had made him see it clearly. It must
not be touched! Daunt was the devil�he was
trying to send him to the copper-mines, to work
underground, with chains on his feet, as long as
he lived!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The Glider heeled suddenly and slid steeply downward.
Daunt gripped the levers and with all his
strength warped up the forward plane. He felt a
pang of sharpened agony. He, too, would fail!
The crash was almost upon him. But the Glider
hung a moment and righted. Farther and farther
he twisted the laterals, till she swam up, oscillating.
A jerk ran through her after framework; he
turned his head. Clinging with foot and hand, his
hair streaming back from his forehead, his lips
wide, Phil was drawing himself, inch by inch, along
the sagging guy-wire toward him.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For a rigid second Daunt could not move a muscle.
Then, caught by the upper wind, the perilous
tilting of the planes awoke him. He swung head
on, wavered, and swooped a last time for the roof.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Pst-pst�pst-pst�Crash! The curved irons of
the grapnel tore away the coping�slid, screaming.
A jolt all but threw him from his seat. There were
running feet somewhere far below him�a battering
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page423" id="page423" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;423]</span>
and shattering of glass in the piazza. He felt a
sudden clearance and the big a�roplane plunged sidewise
out over the bay, with a black, unwieldy
weight, that spun swiftly, hanging on its grapnel.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">A shout tore its way from his lips. Heedless of
direction, he wrenched with his fingers to unship
the grapnel chain. At the same instant the first sunbeam
slid across the waves and turned the misty
gloom to the golden-blue glory of morning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">And with it, as though the voice of the day itself,
there went out over the water, above the sweep of
the wind, a single piercing-sweet note of music, like
the cry of a great, splendid bird calling to the sunrise.
Fishermen in tossing <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>, and sailors on
heaving <i style="text-shadow: none;">junk</i> heard it, and whispered that it was the
cry of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">kaminari</i>, the thunder-animal, or of the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kappa</i> that lures the swimmer to his death. An icy
blast seemed to shoot past the Glider into the zenith.
Staring, Daunt realized that one of the great planes,
the propeller, the after-framework, with the man
who had clung to it, were utterly gone�that the
Glider, like a dead bird caught by the thudding
twinge of a bullet, was lunging by its own momentum�to
its fall! Had Phil fallen, or was it�</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Suddenly he felt himself flung backward, then
forward on his face. The spreading vanes, crumpled
edgewise, like squares of cardboard, were sliding
down. He saw the shipping of the bay spread
beneath him�the twin lighthouses, one red, one
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page424" id="page424" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;424]</span>
white, on the ends of the breakwater�the black
Dreadnaughts�a steamer with bright red funnels�a
fleet of fishing <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i> putting out. All were
swelling larger and larger. The wind, blowing upward
around him, stole his breath, and he felt the
blood beating in his temples. He heard ships' bells
striking, and across the sound a temple-bell boomed
clearly. A mist was coming before his eyes. Just
below him was a white yacht; it seemed to be rushing
up to meet him like a swan.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Thoughts darted through his brain like live arrows.
The battle-ships were saved! No shameful
suspicion should touch Japan's name in the highways
of the world! What matter that he lost the
game? What did one�any one�count against
so much?</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He thought of Barbara. He would never know
now what she had been about to tell him that night
at the Nikko shrine! He would never see her again!
But she would know ... she would know!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The sound of the sea�a great roaring in his ears.</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page425" id="page425" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;425]</span></p>

<small style="text-shadow: none;">INTO THE SUNLIGHT</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">On</span> the deck of the white yacht the captain
rose to his feet. The battle fought on that
huddle of blankets for the life of the man so
hardly snatched from the sea had been a close one,
but it had been won. His smile of satisfaction overran
the group of observant faces at one side, the
bishop watching with strained anxiety, and the girl,
who pillowed in her arms that unconscious head
with its drenched, brown curls.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Don't you be afraid, Miss Fairfax," he said, with
bluff heartiness. "<i style="text-shadow: none;">He'll</i> be all right now!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The assurance came to Barbara's heart with an
infinite relief that he could not guess. At the first
sight of the huge bird-like thing slipping down the
sky she had known the man clinging to its framework
was Daunt. The stricken moments while the
wreck of the great vanes lay outspread on the water�the
launch of the yacht's boat, and the lifting of
the limp form over its gunwale�the cruelly kind
ministrations that had brought breath back to the
inert body�these had seemed to her to consume
dragging hours of agony. A thunder of guns
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page426" id="page426" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;426]</span>
roared across the water, but she scarcely heard.
Her eyes were fixed on the face to which the tide
of life was returning.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Again the roar, and now the sound pierced the
saturating darkness. It called the numbed senses
back to the sphere of feeling�to a consciousness of
an immense weariness and a gentle motion. It
seemed to Daunt as though his head rested on a
pillow which rose and fell to an irregular rhythm.
He stirred. His eyes opened.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Memory dawned across them. Haru's story�the
windy flight on the Glider�the sick sense of
failure�the plunge down, and down, and the water
leaping toward him! Had he failed? A third
time the detonation rang out. He started, made an
effort to rise. His gaze swept the sea. There,
flags flying, bands playing, a line of Dreadnaughts
was steaming down the harbor.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The battle-ships!" he said, and there was triumph
in his eyes.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">He turned his head and saw the bishop, the silent
crew, the relieved countenance of the captain. Realization
came to him. Soft arms were about him;
the pillow that rose and fell was a woman's heaving
breast! His gaze lifted, and Barbara's eyes flowed
into his. He put out a hand weakly and whispered
her name.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She did not speak, but in that look a glory enfolded
him. It was not womanly pity in her face�it
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page427" id="page427" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;427]</span>
was far, far more, something wordless, but eloquent,
veiled, yet passionately tender. He knew
suddenly that after the long night had come the
morning, after the pain and the misunderstanding
all would be well.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">For an instant he closed his eyes, smiling. The
darkness was gone for ever. His head was on her
heart, and it was her dear arms that were lifting
him up, into the sunlight, the sunlight, the sunlight!</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<small style="text-shadow: none;">KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS</small></h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Long</span>, windless, golden days of spring and
falling cherry-petals, with cloud-piles like
fleecy pillars, with fringing palm-plumes
and bamboo foliage turning from yellow cadmium to
tawny green.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Drowsy, lotos-eating days of summer among purple
hills wound in a luminous elfin haze. Days of
typhoon and straight-falling rain. Sunsets of
smouldering crimson and nights under a blue-black
vault palpitating with star-swarms or a waste of turquoise,
liquid with tropic moonlight.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Languorous days of autumn by the Inland Sea,
when the dying summer's breath lingers like the perfume
of incense, and the mirroring lilac water deepens
to bishop's-purple.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">So the mild Japanese winter comes�slowly, under
a high, keen sky, bringing at last its scourging
of dust and wind, its chill, opaque nights with their
spectral fog veiling the trembling flames of the constellations,
and its few, rare days when the evergreen
earth is covered with a blanket of snow.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">There came one such day when Daunt stood with
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page429" id="page429" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;429]</span>
Barbara by the huge stone <i style="text-shadow: none;">torii</i> at the gateway of
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">Mon-to</i> temple on the Hill-of-the-Spirit. The air
was softly radiant but not cold, the translucent
heavens tinted with a fairy mauve, which on the
horizon merged into dying hyacinth. The camelia
hedges stood like blanched rows of crystalled beryl,
the stalwart <i style="text-shadow: none;">mochi</i> trees were cased in argent armor,
and the curving porch of the temple, the roof of the
near-by nunnery, the forest of bronze lanterns and
the square stone tablets in the graveyard were
capped with soft rounded mounds of snow. It lay
thickly over the paved space save where a wide way
had been cleared to the temple steps, for the day was
a <i style="text-shadow: none;">saijits'</i>, a holy day, when the people gather to
worship.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Across the lane they could see the Chapel lifting
its white cross into the clear blue. From its chancel
arch was hung a crucifix of gold-lacquer, where the
declining sun, shining through the stained glass of
the rose-window, each evening touched it to shimmering
color. The altar to-day was fragrant with
the first plum-blossoms; two hours ago the bishop,
standing before it, had read the sacred office which
had made them man and wife. The carriage which
was to take them to Shimbashi Station waited now
at the end of the lane while Barbara brought a
branch of the early blooms to lay on a Buddhist
grave in a tenantless garden.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In one of the farther groups before the temple
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page430" id="page430" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;430]</span>
steps was a miniature <i style="text-shadow: none;">rick-sha</i> drawn by a servant.
It held a child who had not walked since a night
when, with clenched hands and brave little heart, he
had run into the path of a speeding motor-car. On
the breast of his wadded <i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i> was a knot of ribbon
at which the other children gazed in awe and
wonder. It had been pinned one night to a small
hospital shirt when the wandering eyes were hot
with fever and the baby face pinched and white, by
a lady whom Ishikichi had thought must be the Sun
Goddess at very least, and before whom the attendants
of that room of pain had bowed to the very
mats. He knew that in some dim way, without quite
knowing how, he had helped that great, mysterious
something that meant the Government of Japan, and
that he should be very proud of it. But Ishikichi was
far prouder of the fine foreign front that had displaced
the poor little shop in the Street-of-prayer-to-the-Gods.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Nearer the gateway, on the edge of the gathering,
stood an old man, his face seamed and lined, but
with eye clear and young and a smile on his face.
The crest on his sleeve was the <i style="text-shadow: none;">mon</i> of an ancient
and honored <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i> family. He leaned on the arm
of his adopted son�a Commander of the Imperial
Navy whose name had once been Ishida Hetaro.
They stood apart, regarding not the Temple, but the
low building across the hedge, behind whose bamboo
lattice dim forms passed and repassed.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page431" id="page431" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;431]</span>
"Look," said Barbara suddenly, and touched
Daunt's arm. A woman's figure had paused at the
lattice of the nunnery. She was dressed in slate-color
and her delicate features and close-shaven head gave
her a singularly unearthly appearance, like an ethereal
and angelic boy. The little two-wheeled carriage
drew up at the lattice and a slender hand reached out
and patted the round cropped head of its occupant.
As the vehicle was drawn away, the nun looked up
and across the yard�toward the old <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i> and
the young naval officer. The wraith of a flush crept
into her cheek. She smiled, and they smiled in return,
the placid Japanese smile which is the rainbow
of forbidden tears. A second they stood thus, then
the slate-colored figure drew back and was gone, and
the old man, supported by the younger arm, passed
slowly out of the yard.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's eyes were still on the lattice as Daunt
spoke. "What is it?" he asked.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The face of the nun there," she said, with vague
wistfulness. "It reminds me of some one I have
known. Who can it be, I wonder!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">They crossed the yard, and entered the deserted
garden. The great ruin at its side was covered with
friendly shrubs and the all-transfiguring snow. The
line of stepping-stones had been swept clean and beside
the frost-fretted lake an irregular segment of
rock, closely carved with ideographs, had been
planted upright. It stood in mystic peace, looking
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page432" id="page432" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;432]</span>
between the snow-buried, birdless trees toward
the horizon where Fuji-San towered into the infinite
calm�a magical mountain woven of a world
of gems, on which the sun's heart beat in a tumult.
At the base of the stone slab were Buddhist vases
filled with green leaves in fresh water, and in one of
these Barbara placed the branch of plum-blossoms.
Its pink petals lay against the brown rock like the
kiss of spring on a wintry heart.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">As she arranged the sprays, Daunt stood looking
down on her bent head, where, under her fur hat,
the sun was etching gold-hued lines on the soft copper
of her hair. He had taken a yellowed envelope
from his pocket.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Do you remember, dearest," he said, "that I once
told you of an old envelope in the Chancery safe
bearing the name of Aloysius Thorn?"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Yes," she answered wonderingly.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"It was opened, after his death, while you were
away. It contained his will. I turned it into Japanese,
as best I could, for the temple priests. It is
carved there on the stone. The Ambassador gave the
original to the bishop, and he handed it to me to-day
for you. He thought you would like to keep it." He
drew the paper from the discolored envelope and
handed it to her.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">She sat down on a boulder and unfolding the
faded sheets, began to read aloud, in a voice that became
more and more unsteady:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;"><span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page433" id="page433" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;433]</span>
"<span class="smcap" style="text-shadow: none;">Know All Men by These Presents</span>, that I,
Aloysius Thorn, of the city of Tokyo, in Tokyo-fu,
Empire of Japan, being in health and of sound and
disposing mind and memory, do make and publish
this my last will and testament, devising, bequeathing
and disposing in the manner following, to wit:</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Item: I give, devise and bequeath to Japanese
children, inclusively, for and through the term of
their childhood, the woods of cryptomeria, with
their green silences, and the hillsides with the chirpings
of bell-crickets in the <i style="text-shadow: none;">sa-sa</i> grass and the fairy
quiverings of golden butterflies. I give them the
husky crow and the darting swallow under the
eaves. And I devise to them all lotos-pools on which
to sail their straw <i style="text-shadow: none;">sampan</i>, the golden carp and the
lilac-flashing dragon-fly in and above them, and the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">dodan</i> thickets where the <i style="text-shadow: none;">semi</i> chime their silver
cymbals. I also give to them all temple yards,
wheresoever situate, and all moats, and the green
banks thereunto appertaining, for their playgrounds,
providing, however, that they break no tree or
shrub, remembering that trees, like children, have
souls. And I devise to them the golden fire of the
morning and all long, white clouds, to have and to
hold the same, without let or hindrance. These the
above I bequeath to them, possessing no little child
of my own with whom to share my interest in the
world.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"To boys especially I give and bequeath all holidays
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page434" id="page434" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;434]</span>
to be glad in, and the blue sky for their paper
kites. To girls I give and bestow the rainbow
<i style="text-shadow: none;">kimono</i>, the flower in the hair and the battledore.
And I bequeath them all kinds of dolls, reminding
them that these, if loved enough, may some time
come alive.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Item: To young men, jointly, I devise and bequeath
the rough sports of <i style="text-shadow: none;">kenjuts'</i> and of <i style="text-shadow: none;">ju-jits'</i>,
the <i style="text-shadow: none;">shinai</i>-play and all manly games. I give them
the knowledge of all brave legends of the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samurai</i>,
and especially do I leave them the care and respect
for the aged. I give them all far places to travel in
and all manner of strange and delectable adventures
therein. And I apportion to them the high noon,
with its appurtenances, to wit: the heat and burden
of the day, its commotions, its absorbing occupations
and its fiercer rivalries. I give to them, moreover,
the cherry-blossom, the flower of <i style="text-shadow: none;">bushido</i>,
which, falling in the April of its bloom, may ever be
for them the symbol of a life smilingly yielded in
its prime.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"To young women, I give and devise the glow of
the afternoon, the soft blue witchery of pine shadows,
the delicate traceries of the bamboo and the
thin, low laughter of waterfalls. I devise to them all
manner of perfumes, and tender spring blossoms
(save in the one exception provided hereinbefore),
such as the plum-blossom and the wistaria, with the
red maple-leaves and the gorgeous glories of the
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page435" id="page435" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;435]</span>
chrysanthemum. And I give to them all games of
flower-cards, and all divertisements of music, as the
<i style="text-shadow: none;">biwa</i>, the flute and the <i style="text-shadow: none;">samisen</i>, and of dances whatsoever
they may choose.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Item: To the aged I bequeath snowy hair, the
long memories of the past and the golden <i style="text-shadow: none;">ihai</i> on the
Buddha-Shelf. I give them the echo of tiny bare feet
on the <i style="text-shadow: none;">tatam�</i>, and the grave bowing of small shaven
heads. I devise to them the evening's blaze of crimson
glory and the amber clouds above the sunset, the
pale <i style="text-shadow: none;">andon</i> and the indigo shadows, the dusk dance
of the yellow lanterns, the gathering of friends at
the moon-viewing place and the liquid psalmody of
the nightingale. I give to them also the winter, the
benediction of snow-bent boughs and the waterways
gliding with their silver smiles. I give to them sufficient
space to lie down within a temple ground that
echoes the play of little children. And finally I bequeath
to them the love and blessing of succeeding
generations for the blossoming of a hundred lives.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"In testimony whereof, I, the said Aloysius
Thorn�"</p>

<hr style="text-shadow: none;">

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Barbara's voice broke off. Her eyes were wet as
she folded the paper. Daunt drew her to her feet,
and with his arm about her, they stood looking out
across the white city lying in all its ghostly glamour�the
many-gabled watch-towers above the castle
walls, the glistening plateau of Aoyama with its dull
<span class="pagenum" style="text-shadow: none;"><a name="page436" id="page436" style="text-shadow: none;"></a>[pg&nbsp;436]</span>
red barracks, the rolling sea of wan roofs, and far
beyond, the creeping olive of the bay. In the clear
distance they could see the lift of Kudan Hill, and
the gray pile of the Russian Cathedral. Standing in
its candle-lighted nave, they had listened to Japanese
choir-boys hymning the Birth in Bethlehem. The
next Christmas they two would be together�but in
another land!</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"Minister to Persia!" she said. "I am glad of
your appointment, for it means so much to your
career. And yet�and yet�"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the temple yard behind them an acolyte, wading
knee-deep in the snow, swung the cedar beam of the
bell-tower and the deep-voiced boom rolled out
across the cradling hush. Again and yet again it
struck, the waves of sound throbbing into volume
through the still air. It came to them like a firm and
beautiful voice, the articulate echo of the Soul of
Japan.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The whinny of restive horses stole over the
hedges. Silently Daunt held out his hand to her.
She bent and picked a single plum-blossom from the
branch and slipped it into the yellow envelope. For
a last time she looked out across the distance.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">"The beautiful country!" she said.</p>

<p class="h2" style="text-shadow: none;">THE END</p>

<hr class="hr2" style="text-shadow: none;">

<div class="tnote" style="text-shadow: none;">
<h2 style="text-shadow: none;">Transcriber Notes:</h2>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Throughout the dialogues, there were words used to mimic accents of
the speakers. Those words were retained as-is.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">In the table of contents, "BANZAI NIPPON" was replaced with "BANZAI NIPPON!"</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">The illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up
paragraphs and so that they are next to the text they illustrate.</p>

<p class="indent" style="text-shadow: none;">Errors in punctuation, inconsistent hyphenation, and idiosyncratic

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
