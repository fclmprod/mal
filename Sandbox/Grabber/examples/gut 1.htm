<p>
It is not so much the object of the author, with regard to the various
arts treated of in the following pages, to convey to professed artists,
a more accurate and extensive knowledge of those arts, as to explain
some of the first lines and principles of them, for the advantage of
those, who may be induced to practice them occasionally, either for
profit or amusement. The chemical experiments are such as are calculated
to combine recreation, with improvement in useful knowledge�a knowledge
of some of the leading principles of chemistry.�The true chemical
terms, according to the new nomenclature (which, perhaps, may not be so
readily understood, by some, as the more common and familiar names, but
will be found sufficiently explained in the appendix) have, in this
work, been applied to the various articles occasionally mentioned. Very
few substances have been mentioned, which are generally considered
poisonous, or otherwise dangerous; but it may be proper, however, for
those who may attempt any of the chemical experiments, to proceed with
caution, and carefully avoid the fumes produced by chemical action,
especially in metallic solutions in nitric acid, and sublimation of
mercury. Several articles in this little collection, will probably be
found to contain some improvements, and if it prove as interesting to
others, as a similar work would formerly have been to the author, his
object will have been attained.

1. <span class="sc">Water-proof gilding and silvering.</span>�This kind of gilding,
usually termed oil gilding, being the cheapest and most durable, is in
general use for gilding or silvering letters on signs, labels, &amp;c. and
may be performed as follows:�Grind one ounce of white lead and two
ounces of litharge, very fine, in a gill of old linseed oil, and if
convenient, add nearly one-fourth of a gill of old copal varnish, and
half an ounce of stone yellow; but neither of these last, are very
essential ingredients. Expose this composition to the rays of the sun
for a week or more in a broad open vessel, observing, however, to keep
it free from dust. Then pour off the finest part, and dilute it with as
much spirits of turpentine as will make it work freely with a brush or
camel-hair pencil. (Oil that will answer exceedingly well for this
purpose, may sometimes be collected from the top of oil paints that
have been long standing, and may be used directly, without being
exposed to the sun as directed above.) Whatever letters or figures you
would gild, must be first drawn or painted with this sizing, the ground
having been previously painted and varnished; and when the sizing is so
dry as to be hard, but yet remains slightly adhesive, or sticky, lay on
gold or silver leaves smoothly over the whole, pressing them down
gently with a soft ball of cotton. The most convenient manner of
performing this, is to lay the leaves of gold or silver, first on a
piece of deer-skin or glove-leather, and cut them into pieces of a
convenient size, by drawing a smooth (not sharp) edged knife over them.
Then take a small block of wood, of a triangular form, about half an
inch thick, and two inches in diameter, and bind a strip of fine
flannel round the edges;�breathe on this, and press it gently on a
piece of the leaf, which by this may be taken from the leather, and
carried to any part of the sizing where it will best fit, and to which
it will readily adhere: thus the sizing may be readily covered with the
leaf, very little of which will be wasted. Afterward the whole may be
brushed over lightly with cotton, or a soft brush, and the superfluous
gold or silver will be brushed off, leaving the letters or figures
entire. When the work has thus remained two or three days, it may be
rubbed with a piece of silk, which will increase its metallic lustre.
<i>Note.</i>�It is very essential that the varnish of the ground
should be thoroughly dry, that it may not be adhesive in the least
degree, otherwise the leaf will stick where it should not, and
materially injure the work. When plain gilding is required for vanes,
balls, &amp;c. the leaves of gold or silver may be applied to the work
directly from the book, without cutting or dividing them.
</p>

<p class="item">
2. <span class="sc">The art of burnish gilding.</span>�Make a sizing by boiling the
skins of beaver and musk rats, (which may be readily procured at a hat
manufactory,) in water, till it is of sufficient strength that by
cooling it will become a stiff jelly; strain the liquor while warm, and
give your work one coat of it with a brush; when this is dry, add a
little fine whiting to the sizing, and give the work one coat of this.
Then add as much whiting as will work freely under the brush, and lay
on five or six coats of this, allowing each a sufficient time to dry.
Smooth the work by wetting it, and rubbing it with a piece of pumice
stone, which should be previously cut and fitted to the moulding or
other work that is to be gilt; afterward, when the work is dry, rub
it with some fine sand paper. Then take some burnish-gold-size (which
is composed of pipe-clay, plumbago, beef tallow and castile soap, but
may be easily procured ready made,) and dilute it with water till it
is of the consistence of very soft putty, and afterward with the
above mentioned sizing till it will flow freely from a brush, and give
the work three successive coats of this; when the last is dry, dip a
camel-hair pencil in a mixture of equal quantities of rum and water,
and with it wet a small part of the work, and immediately, while it is
flowing, lay on a leaf of gold, brushing it down with a very soft, flat
camel-hair brush, with which also, the leaf is usually conveyed from
the book to the sizing; proceed thus till the whole is gilt, and let it
dry. When the work is sufficiently dry to take a fair polish by
burnishing, (which can be only ascertained by applying the burnisher to
different parts of the work occasionally while it is drying,) rub over
the whole carefully with a flint burnisher, or with the tooth of a wolf
or dog, being fixed in a convenient handle, till the whole acquires a
brilliant polish, except such parts as are required to remain in a
rough-gilt state, which parts are usually flatted by a coat of thin
sizing. Such are the principal rules of the art of burnish gilding; but
as this business requires some variation of management, according to
the state of the weather and other circumstances, it may not be
expected that any person should become very expert in the art, without
the advantage of some experience and practice.

<p class="item">
3. <span class="sc">Ornamental bronze gilding.</span>�This is performed by means of
gold or silver, reduced to an impalpable powder, called bronze. One
method of preparing it, is to levigate any quantity of gold or silver
leaves on a stone, with some clarified honey; dilute the honey with
clear water, that the bronze may settle; pour off the water and honey,
and add fresh water to the bronze, which, after being thus thoroughly
washed, may be dried on paper, and is ready for use. Another method of
preparing the gold bronze, is to precipitate the gold from its solution
in nitro-muriatic acid, (see 5,) by adding sulphate of iron to the
solution;�then washing it, as directed above. But in general it will
be found much cheaper to buy the bronze ready prepared. The ground for
this work must be varnished with a mixture of copal varnish, with an
equal quantity of old linseed oil; and whatever figures are to be
formed in bronzing, must be represented by holes cut through pieces of
paper. Lay these patterns on the work, when the varnish is so dry as to
be but slightly adhesive, but not press them down any more than is
requisite to keep the paper in its place. Then take a piece of soft
glove-leather, moisten it a little by breathing on it, and dip it in
some dry bronze, and apply it to the figures, beginning at the
edges;�tap the figure gently with the leather, and the bronze will
stick to the varnish according to the pattern. Thus any figure may be
produced in a variety of shades, by applying the bronze more freely to
some parts of the work than to others. If some internal parts of the
figures require to be more distinct than others, they may be wrought by
their peculiar patterns, or may be edged with dark coloured paint. In
some work it may be well to extend the varnish no farther than the
intended figures, in which case, any projecting or branching parts of
the figures, may be drawn with a camel-hair pencil, and the patterns
may in some measure be dispensed with. In either case, the work must
afterwards have one or more coats of copal or shellac varnish.

4. <span class="sc">To enamel picture glasses with gold.</span>�The glass must first
be washed perfectly clean and dried; then damp it by breathing on it,
or wet it with the tongue, and immediately lay on a leaf of gold, and
brush it down smooth. When this is dry, draw any letters or flowers on
the gold with Brunswick blacking, (see 51) and when dry, the
superfluous gold may be brushed off with cotton, leaving the figures
entire. Afterward the whole may be covered with blacking, or painted in
any colour, while the gold figures will appear to advantage on the
opposite side of the glass. This work may be elegantly shaded by
scratching through the gold with a small steel instrument, (in the end
of which many sharp points are formed,) previous to laying on the
blacking. Oil paints of any kind may be substituted in the place of the
blacking, but will not dry so quick.

<p class="item">
5. <span class="sc">To wash iron or steel with gold.</span>�Mix together in a phial,
one part of nitric acid, with two parts of muriatic acid, and add as
much fine gold as the acid will dissolve. For this purpose gold leaf is
the most convenient, as it will be the most readily dissolved. (This
solution is called the nitro-muriate of gold.) Pour over this solution,
cautiously, about half as much sulphuric ether;�shake the mixture, and
then allow it to settle. The ether will take the gold from the acid,
and will separate itself from it also, and form an upper stratum in the
phial. Carefully pour off this auriferous ether into another phial, and
cork it close. Wash any piece of steel or iron with this ether, and
immediately plunge it in cold water, and it will have acquired a coat
of pure gold. With this also, any flowers or letters may be drawn or
written, even with a pen, and will appear perfectly gilt. The steel or
iron should afterward be heated as much as it will bear without
changing colour, and if the steel be previously polished, the beauty of
the gilding may be much increased by burnishing with a cornelian or
blood stone.

6. <span class="sc">To wash brass or copper with silver.</span>�To half an ounce of
nitric acid in a phial, add one ounce of water, and one fourth of an
ounce of good silver. It will soon be dissolved, and if the acid and
metal are both pure, the solution, (which is called nitrate of silver)
will be transparent and colourless. Add to this a solution of nearly
two drachms of muriate of soda, in any quantity of water; this will
precipitate the silver in a white opaque mass. Pour off the water with
the acid, and add to the silver an equal quantity of super-tartrate
of potass, thus forming a soft paste;�dip a piece of soft leather in
his paste, and rub it on the metal to be silvered; continue rubbing
it till it is nearly dry; then wash it with water, and polish by
rubbing it hard with a piece of dry leather. Another method is, to add
sub-carbonate of potass to the nitrate of silver, as long as ebulition
ensues; then the acid is poured off, and the precipitate, (which is
white at first, but becomes green when dry,) is mixed with double its
quantity of muriate of soda, and super-tartrate of potass. With this
composition, being moistened, the metal is rubbed over, &amp;c.

9. <span class="sc">To dye silk a brilliant gold colour.</span>�Take any quantity of
nitro-muriate of gold, (see 5) and evaporate by exposing it to a gentle
heat in a glass tumbler or phial; the gold will form itself in crystals
on the bottom and sides of the vessel; collect these crystals and
dissolve them in ten times their weight of pure water. Then put a gill
of water into a common flask, and add one ounce of granulated zinc, and
one-fourth of an ounce of sulphuric acid. Hydrogen gas will be evolved,
and rise through the neck of the flask, which must not be stopped.
Immerse a piece of white silk in the above mentioned aqueous solution
of gold, and expose it, while wet, to the current of gas as it rises
from the flask; the gold will soon be revived, and the silk will become
beautifully and permanently gilt. Any letters or flowers may be drawn
on the silk with a camel-hair pencil dipped in the solution, and on
being exposed to the action of the gas, will be revived and shine with
metallic brilliancy. <i>Note.</i>�The silk must be kept moist with
water till the gold is revived. Zinc may be prepared for the above
purpose, by melting it, and stirring it continually with a stick or
iron rod while it is cooling; or it may be pulverized with a hammer as
soon as it becomes solid.

10. <span class="sc">To dye silk a brilliant silver colour.</span>�Proceed as
directed in the last experiment, only use the nitrate of silver, (see
6) instead of nitro-muriate of gold. The process of crystalizing,
re-dissolving, &amp;c. is the same. But the crystals of silver differ in
colour, being white, whereas those produced from gold are yellow. If a
jar, or box be filled with hydrogen gas, and the silk suspended in it,
the action of the gas, and consequently the revivification of the
metals will be more uniform. For small figures, however, it may be as
well to fix a stopper in the flask, having a small orifice through it,
that the gas may be thrown with some force on the silk, and will have a
more certain effect. A solution of muriate of tin may be managed in a
similar manner, but none of these solutions can be thus revived on

11. <span class="sc">To silver looking glasses.</span>�Lay on a smooth board, a piece
of soft deer-skin leather, rather larger than the glass that is to be
silvered; and on the leather, having sprinkled a little fine whiting,
spread a piece of tin foil of the same size. Pour on a few drops of
mercury, and brush it over the tin with a smooth brush, till every part
of the tin becomes bright. Then add as much mercury as will lay on the
tin, and upon this lay the glass to be silvered: on the glass lay
another piece of leather, of the same size, and on that another
board.�Take up the boards with the glass, and pressing the boards
together, turn them with the glass, the other side up; take off the
upper board, and pass the glass with the tin and leather, between two
rollers, similar to those of a rolling press, for copper-plate
printing; thus to press out the mercury from between the tin and the
glass. Then place the glass between the boards again as before, and
place a heavy weight (which cannot be too heavy, unless it breaks the
glass) on the upper board, which must remain two or three days. The
glass may then be taken up. The practice of some is, to lay thin paper
on the mercury previous to laying on the glass; this paper, being
carefully drawn out, after the glass is laid on, serves to remove the
superfluous mercury, that the tin may come more nearly in contact with
the glass. In this case, no rollers are used. Concave or other fancy
glasses may be silvered, by making an impression with the glass, in a
kind of putty, made of fine sulphate of lime and water; and placing the
glass in the impression again with the tin foil and mercury, when the
plaster is dry, and subjecting it to pressure two or three days in that
situation. The experiment of silvering glass may be performed by
rubbing a drop of mercury on a small piece of tin foil, and pressing it
upon a piece of glass with the finger, or a piece of soft leather. In
this case, the glass will have acquired the reflective property of a
mirror; and if a similar pressure be continued a few hours, the tin
will adhere permanently.

nearly breast high; this is called the horizon line: paint the walls
from the top to within six inches of the horizon line, with sky blue,
(composed of refined whiting and indigo, or slip blue,) and at the same
time, paint the space from the horizon line to the blue, with horizon
red, (whiting, coloured a little with orange lead and yellow ochre,)
and while the two colours are wet, incorporate them partially, with a
brush. Rising clouds may be represented by striking the horizon red
colour upon the blue, before it is dry, with a large brush. Change some
sky blue about two shades with slip blue and paint your design for
rivers, lakes or the ocean. Change some sky blue one shade with forest
green, (slip blue and chrome yellow,) and paint the most distant
mountains and highlands; shade them while wet, with blue, and heighten
them with white, observing always to heighten the side that is towards
the principal light of the room. The upper surface of the ocean must be
painted as high as the horizon line, and the distant highlands must
rise from ten to twenty inches above it.�Paint the highlands, islands,
&amp;c. of the second distance, which should appear from four to six miles
distant, with mountain green, (two parts sky blue with one of forest
green,) heighten them, while wet, with sulphur yellow, (three parts
whiting with one of chrome yellow,) and shade with blue-black, (slip
blue and lamp black equal.) Paint the lands of the first distance, such
as should appear within a mile or two, with forest green; heighten with
chrome yellow and shade with black; occasionally incorporating red
ochre, french green or whiting. The nearest part, or fore ground,
however, should be painted very bold with yellow ochre, stone brown,
(red and yellow ochres and lamp black equal,) and black. Paint the
shores and rocks of the first distance with stone brown; heighten with
horizon red, shade with black. For those of the second distance, each
colour must be mixed with sky blue.�The wood lands, hedges and trees
of the second distance are formed by striking a small flat stiff brush
end-wise, (which operation is called bushing, and is applied to the
heightening and shading all trees and shrubbery of any distance,) with
mountain green, deepened a little with slip blue; with which also the
ground work for trees of the first distance is painted; and with this
colour the water may be shaded a little under the capes and islands,
thus representing the reflection of the land in the water. Trees of the
first distance are heightened with sulphur yellow or french green; and
shaded with blue-black. Every object must be painted larger or smaller,
according to the distance at which it is represented; thus the proper
height of trees in the second distance, is from one to two inches, and
other objects in proportion. Those in the first distance from six to
ten inches generally; but those in the fore ground, which are nearest,
are frequently painted as large as the walls will admit. The colours
also for distant objects, houses, ships, &amp;c., must be varied, being
mixed with more or less sky blue, according to the distance of the
object. By these means the view will apparently recede from the eye,

the work one or two coats of straw coloured paint, composed of white
lead and yellow ochre, ground in linseed oil, to which may be added a
little fine litharge, that the paint may the sooner dry; when this is
dry, rub it smooth with sand-paper. Then if mahogany is to be imitated,
stain the work over with boiled linseed oil, coloured a little with
venetian red and burnt terra-de-sienna, equal quantities. This should
be applied with a short stiff brush, and spread very thin that it may
not run, or drip off. Then with terra-de-sienna, ground very thick in
oil, form the dark shades of the graining according to your design,
with a small flat brush. For this purpose a common sash-brush may be
made flat, by having a small piece of wire, or wood, bound on each side
near the handle. Some of the darker shades may be drawn with burnt
umber and black, ground together, which may be applied with a camel
hair pencil. If any part is to be made very light, the staining may be
wiped off carefully with a ball of cotton. Light stripes, or lines may
be produced by drawing a piece of cork or soft wood over the work, thus
taking off or removing the dark colours, that the original ground may
appear.�To imitate maple, the work must be stained with yellow ochre,
and burnt umber, ground together in boiled oil. Instead of burnt umber,
terra-de-sienna (unburnt) is sometimes used, but as different kinds, or
parcels of it, vary in colour, from yellow to brown, it may not be
depended on uniformly. The birds' eyes and curls are formed by removing
the staining from the ground with a piece of stiff leather, the edges
of which are cut in notches so that the several points will touch the

will not dry so quick. The most proper colours for this work, on
account of their transparency, are india ink, or lamp black, burnt
umber, burnt terra-de-sienna, lake and gamboge or chrome yellow. These
must be laid on very thin, that they may be the more transparent. Set
up the glass on its edge, against a window, or place a lamp on the
opposite side that the light may shine through, and with a fine hair
pencil, draw the out lines of your design on the glass with black;
afterward shade and paint it with the above mentioned colours,
observing to paint that part of the work first, which in other painting
would be done last. The shading may be performed by laying on two or
more coats of the colour, where you want it darker. If transparency is
not required, a greater variety of colours may be used, and laid on in
full heavy coats. Any writing or lettering in this work, must be
written from right to left, contrary to the usual order. In some
pieces, the body of some of the principal objects, may be left blank,
so that by placing pieces of silk or paper of different colours, on the
opposite side of the glass the picture will also appear in different
colours, and may be changed from one colour to another at pleasure.

other similar instruments, the wheel should not be more than five or
six inches in diameter, and two inches thick. The steel must first be
ground smooth as possible on a common, or fine grained stone; it may
then be applied to the polishing wheel, which must be turned with such
velocity that the surface, or rim, may move at the rate of from forty
to sixty feet in a second; and the leather must frequently have a
powder applied, called crocus of iron, which is prepared by calcining
sulphate of iron in a crucible till it becomes a fine red oxide
resembling rust. For ordinary work, the leather may be moistened with
olive oil, that it may the better retain the powder; but it will give a
more perfect polish if kept dry. If any perfectly plain surfaces, such
as mirrors are to be polished, they must be applied to the sides of a

together, coloured a little with lamp black, and diluted with spirits
of turpentine, so as to work freely with a camel hair pencil, draw any
letters or figures on the steel, while it is a little warm. When the

two parts water, to one of acid; thus take off the blue colour, and
then wash it with clear water. Afterward the varnish, being warmed a
little, may be readily washed off with spirits of turpentine, and the
letters or flowers will remain blue. <i>Note.</i>�If letters are
formed of polished steel with this varnish, and the body of the metal
be also covered with it, except a small space round the letters, and
then bathed with muriatic acid, the space round the letters, will
become a dull iron colour, while the letters and the body of the steel

this composition, and when the spirits have evaporated, rub the work
hard with a piece of glove leather, and wipe off nearly all the wax,
that the metal may retain its brightness. This may be applied to iron
or steel in machinery, or other work, and will be found to answer a
much better purpose than oil, as it is less liable to collect dust from

twice as much finely ground muriate of soda, as the water will
dissolve, and as much rye flour as will, with the other, make a thick
paste; lay a coat of this paste over the steel, (which must be ground,
or filed previous to tempering,) and subject it to a full red heat, in
a fire of charcoal, mixed with about a third part of animal coal, (coal
of bones, horns, leather, &amp;c.) and then suddenly plunge it three or
four feet deep, in exceeding cold water. By thus immersing the steel
rather deep in the water there is a double advantage; for the water
which becomes heated, by contact with the steel, will rise and its
place be supplied continually by fresh cold water; and at the same
time, the pressure of the water on the coating of paste, will make it
adhere more closely to the steel while it is cooling. The paste may
then be shelled off, and the steel will be found as bright as before,
or at least, will not have been essentially oxydized by the operation.

40. <span class="sc">To wash iron or steel with copper.</span>�Dissolve sulphate of
copper in water, in the proportion of one to three; wash the iron or
steel with it, and it will instantly be covered with reduced copper.
This is best performed by applying the solution with a brush, which
must be followed directly with a sponge of clear water. In this manner
any letters or figures may be drawn with a camel-hair pencil, or a pen,
and if it be on polished steel, the letters or flowers will assume the
brilliancy of the steel and appear like highly polished copper. It may
sometimes be requisite to cleanse the metal by washing it with diluted
muriatic acid, that the copper may adhere the more readily. If the
steel thus ornamented, be held over a charcoal fire, the copper figures
become blue first; and when the steel becomes blue, the copper takes a
gold colour; but is restored again to its original colour, by diluted
muriatic acid.

the last experiment, brush it over in the same manner with the diluted
nitrate of mercury; its appearance will be equal, if not superior to
that of real silver. In this manner any common, or rough iron work, may
be apparently silvered at a most insignificant expense.

42. <span class="sc">To wash iron with tin.</span>�Small pieces of iron may be
tinned, after being filed bright, by washing them with a saturated
solution of muriate of ammonia in water and dipping them, while moist,
in a vessel of melted tin. If the iron is of such form as cannot be
conveniently filed, it may be immersed in nitric acid, diluted with as
much water as acid; when the acid begins to act sensibly on every part,
it may be washed with water, and then with the muriate of ammonia, and
if a little fine rosin be sprinkled on it previous to dipping it in the
tin, it may be an advantage. The iron must remain in the tin till it
becomes nearly as hot as the tin, otherwise it will be coated too
thick. Muriatic acid may sometimes be used, instead of muriate of
ammonia, and if the iron is not filed, it will answer a better purpose.
The inside of cast iron vessels may be tinned as follows: Cleanse the
iron by scouring or rubbing it with a sharp grained stone, keeping the
iron wet with diluted nitric acid. As the most prominent parts of the
iron will be first brightened by the stone, the acid will also commence
its action on the same parts, which will very much facilitate the work,
while the hollows, and deeper parts of the surface, will remain
untouched till the iron is nearly smooth. When this is accomplished,
wash the iron with water, and then with clear muriatic acid; turn the
vessel over to drain off the superfluous acid; then set it upright, and
fill it with melted tin, which must be poured in cautiously, directly
on the bottom of the vessel first, and the stream of tin increased till
the vessel is full; then pour out the tin suddenly, and invert the
vessel till it is cold. Sheets of iron are tinned, in the manufactories
of tin plate, by immersing the sheets, endwise, in a pot of melted tin,
the top of which is covered with about two inches depth of tallow. This
tallow answers a better purpose, after it has become brown by use, than
it does at first. The only preparation of the iron sheets is, to scour
them perfectly clean and bright.

ounce of nitric acid, diluted with an equal quantity of water, add
nearly an ounce of mercury, or as much as the acid will dissolve. When
this is dissolved, add to the solution, gradually, half an ounce of
sulphuric acid; this will precipitate the mercury in the form of a
white powder; when this has subsided, pour off the acid and add clear
water; thus wash the powder from the acid, then pour off the water, and
while the precipitate is moist, (or if it be suffered to dry, it may be
again moistened with water,) rub it over the tin with a piece of glove
leather.�Then wash the tin with water, and when it is dry, rub it
pretty hard with a piece of fine woollen cloth; it will resemble
polished silver.

44. <span class="sc">To give tin a changeable crystalline appearance.</span>�Cleanse
the tin by washing it with warm soap and water, and rinse it in clear
water. Then heat the tin to the temperature of bare sufferance to the
hand, and pour on it, or apply with a brush or sponge, a mixture of one
ounce of muriatic acid, with one fourth of an ounce of sulphuric acid,
and two ounces of water; then immediately wash the tin in clear water.
Another method is, to apply in the same manner a solution of two ounces
of muriate of soda, in four ounces of water, with one ounce of nitric
acid. In either case, if the crystalline figures are not bold enough,
the operation may be repeated. If a very small figure is required, the
tin may be heated nearly to flowing, and plunged into cold water,
slightly acidulated with nitric and muriatic acids. If a little solder
is drawn over the tin with a hot iron or copper, in such manner as to
form a cross, or circle, and the opposite side of the tin be afterwards
crystallized, it will have a beautiful effect.

boiler, that is small at the top will answer to melt the gum in. For
ordinary or coarse work, a larger proportion of oil and a little rosin
may be added. If oil is used in which red lead and litharge (in the
proportion of half a pound of each to a gallon of oil) have been
previously boiled, the varnish will the sooner dry.

addition of venice turpentine, by means of which, a small quantity of
gum-copal, finely powdered, may also be dissolved, but as venice

cotton cambric, rather larger than the map or picture to be varnished,
and draw it straight upon a frame of convenient size, and confine it
at the edges by small tacks or nails. Lay a thin coat of fine rye
flour paste on this, and on the back of the paper that is to be
varnished; lay the paper on the cambric and press them together till
the paper adheres firmly in every part. When this is dry, give the
face of the print two or three coats of a strong solution of
gum-arabic in water, allowing each sufficient time to become perfectly
dry. This sizing must be applied with a large smooth brush, and must
be spread over the work very quickly, and with as little brushing as
possible. Afterwards, give the work one or more coats of the varnish
described at 48. <i>Note.</i>�Very small prints may not require to be
pasted on cambric; and if the paper be very thick, the varnish may be
applied without the previous sizing. Ising-glass, (which may be
readily dissolved in boiling water) is sometimes added to the
gum-arabic, and increases the strength of the sizing, but is somewhat
less transparent than pure gum-arabic. A more simple method of
varnishing prints, is to size them with a solution of loaf sugar, and
finish with a solution of rosin in spirits of turpentine.

<p class="item">
53. <span class="sc">Best method of tracing or copying a picture.</span>�Perhaps the
most simple method of copying the outlines of a picture, is to place
the picture against a window, with the paper over it, on which the copy
is to be drawn; the principal lines of the picture will be seen through
the other paper, and may readily be traced with a lead pencil. But the
usual manner of copying, in landscape painting, and which will answer
for pictures of any size, is to rub over the back of the picture with
plumbago, or red ochre; then lay the picture on the ground that is to
receive the copy, and trace the lines with a smooth pointed steel, or
piece of hard wood. The ground will thus be very accurately and
distinctly marked, by the plumbago or ochre adhering to the ground in
the lines that are traced. When several copies are to be taken from the
same pattern, (which frequently occurs in ornamental painting,) the
outlines of the first copy may be perforated with some pointed
instrument, so that being laid on the other grounds that are to receive
the copies, and brushed over with a little fine dry whiting, or red
ochre, (as the case may require) the whiting or ochre will penetrate
the perforated lines of the pattern, and thus mark the ground on which
it is laid.

<p class="item">
54. <span class="sc">The construction and use of a copying machine.</span>�Take two
strips of wood, which may be about three feet long, one inch wide, and
one-fourth of an inch thick; lay them on a table, parallel to each
other, and eighteen inches apart. Across these, lay three other strips,
which must be eighteen inches long, that each end of each piece may
rest on one of the longer strips. Two of these must lie across the
opposite ends of the longer pieces, and the other across the centre,
thus forming two squares. Drive a pin through the ends of the short
pieces, or confine them by rivets to the others, but not so as to
prevent their playing circularly on the rivets. Then drive a pin or
pivot through the centre of the middle cross-bar into the table, or
board on which the work lies. In one end of one of the long strips
(which may project a little over the cross-bar) fix a lead pencil, with
the point downward, so that it may bear lightly on the board; and under
this pencil, place the paper that is to receive the copy. And in the
opposite end of the other piece, fix a smooth iron point, in a manner
similar to that of the pencil, and under this point place the picture
that is to be copied. Then with the iron point, carefully trace the
lines of the picture, and the pencil in the opposite corner will move
in a transverse direction, and draw the same picture very accurately on
the other paper. If you fix the pencil half way between its former
place and the middle cross-bar, and remove the pivot to a point that is
directly in a line with the pencil and the iron point, it will give a
copy in exact proportion, but only one fourth part as large as the
picture that is copied. Thus the copy may be decreased or increased to
any size, and still retain its regular proportions. In this manner,
painting on wood or canvas may be copied, which could not readily be
done in any other way.

<p class="item">
55. <span class="sc">To produce the exact likeness of any object, instantly on
paper.</span>�This may be readily effected by laying the paper on a
table, and holding a double convex lens (a common sun-glass) over it,
and then placing a mirror over the lens, in an oblique position so as
to face partly downward, and partly towards the object that is to be
represented. The rays of light passing from the object to the mirror,
will be reflected downward through the lens, and produce the likeness
of the object in full colours on the paper. This experiment may be
easily made in the evening, by reflecting the flame of a candle in this
manner, which will appear very brilliant on the paper. But in order to
render the reflection of an object distinctly visible by day light, it
may be requisite to exclude nearly all the light from the paper, except
what falls through the lens. In all cases, the lens must be placed at a
distance above the paper, according to its focus, or the distance at
which it would contract the rays of the sun to the smallest point. A
very convenient camera obscura, for drawing landscapes, or even
portraits may be constructed as follows: Make a box of boards, in the
form of a regular cube, being one foot in length, breadth and height;
bore a hole of one inch diameter, through the centre of the top; and on
this, fix a double convex lens, the focus of which must reach the
bottom of the box. Make an aperture of about six inches in length, and
one in breadth, through one side of the box at the top, by shaving off,
or hollowing the edge in such manner that when you put your face to the
aperture to look into the box, it will exclude all the light except
what falls through the lens. Make a hole through each end of the box,
near the bottom, large enough to put in the hands, with paper and
pencil. On the top of the box, on the right and left sides of the lens,
fix two pieces of boards, which may be about four inches high, eight
inches long, and three inches distant from each other. Between these
boards, fix a piece of looking glass, three inches square, and facing
from you; the lower edge of the glass, being near the lens, on the side
towards you; and the upper edge inclining towards you about thirty
degrees from a perpendicular. Directly over, and nearly four inches
above the lens, place another mirror, the centre of which must face
directly towards the lower edge of the first. Cover the glass-box so as
to exclude all the light from the glasses except what falls on them
horizontally from objects directly in front of you, and place a sheet
of paper on the bottom of the box inside. The rays of light, passing
from objects in front, will be reflected from the first mirror to the
second, and from the second, through the lens to the paper, where you
will have a perfect similitude of the objects in view, in full colours,
and true perspective, and may trace them on the paper, with a pencil or
pen.

56. <span class="sc">Copper-plate engraving.</span>�For this purpose, provide a plate
of copper, rather larger than the design that is to be engraved, and
may be about one sixteenth of an inch thick; planish by rubbing it,
first, directly length-wise, and afterwards breadth-wise with a piece
of pumice-stone, which may be dipped occasionally in a mixture of one
part nitric acid, with six or seven parts water.�Then wash the copper
with clear water, and rub it with an oil stone that has a plane
surface; and then polish it with a piece of charcoal, that has been
ignited to redness and quenched in cold water. Afterwards burnish the
copper by rubbing it with polished steel. Lay a piece of transparent
paper on the design that is to be engraved, and trace the principal
lines with a lead pencil;�then brush over the copy or tracing with dry
red ochre, and having rubbed the copper plate with a piece of bees-wax,
lay the red side of the tracing on the plate; then with a smooth iron
point, trace the same lines again, that they may thus be transferred to
the plate by means of the red ochre and wax. Take up the paper and
trace the lines on the plate with a needle, thus scoring the lines
slightly on the copper. Then warm the plate and wipe off the wax, or
wash it off with spirits of turpentine, and rub the plate with fine dry
whiting. The next instrument to proceed with is the graver; consisting
of a blade of steel about three inches long, which is fixed in a
convenient handle like an awl. The form of the graver should be
triangular, or between a triangle and lozenge, having two sides plane
and the other round or swelled; and should taper regularly from the
handle to the point, or nearly so, but the point must be ground off
obliquely so that the edge may extend a little farther than the back;
and the edge should rise a little rounding towards the point. It is
very essential that the edge and point of the graver should be kept
very sharp. The manner of holding the graver, is to take the handle
into the hollow of the hand, pressing it with three fingers, on one
side, and the thumb on the other, and extend the fore finger on the
back of the blade towards the point.�The edge of the graver must rest
on the plate, and its motion when cutting must be endwise in all cases;
though there evidently might be a graver constructed, which might, in
some cases, be handled in a manner more similar to that of a pen or
pencil. A graver of a square form may also be requisite, for cutting
large and broad lines occasionally. In proceeding to engrave the plate,
begin with the outlines, observing to press harder or lighter on the
graver, as the lines require to be larger or smaller, and finish each
line with the same motion if possible, without taking the graver off
the plate. Having cut the outlines, proceed to fill up, and shade the
work discretionally, according to the design. It may be requisite,
after part of the work is engraved, to scrape it lightly with the edge
of the graver, to take off any roughness, that may have been formed on
the part engraved. If after finishing the design, any part appears to
have been improperly executed, such parts may be erased by the
burnisher, and may be re-engraved with the requisite amendments.

<p class="item">
57. <span class="sc">Etching on copper plates.</span>�Melt together two ounces of
bees-wax, and one ounce of venice turpentine, and when the wax is
melted and boils, add by small quantities, two ounces of gum-asphaltum,
stirring the mixture briskly at the same time; and when the mixture is
well incorporated, take it from the fire, let it cool a little, and
then pour it into warm water, and by working it with the hands, form it
into balls of about an inch in diameter, and wrap each of them in a
piece of taffety, or thin silk. Then, having prepared and polished a
plate of copper, as directed for copper-plate engraving, warm the plate
sufficiently to melt the balls of wax varnish, and rub one of them over
it, till every part of the polished side is covered with the varnish;
then with a ball of cotton, wrapped or tied up in taffety, beat every
part of the varnished plate gently, while the varnish is yet flowing,
that it may spread the more even and uniformly. Then hold the plate in
a horizontal position, with the varnished side down, and hold the flame
of a wax candle under it, or a small roll of paper that has been dipped
in melted wax, and thus blacken the varnish while the plate is yet warm
enough to keep it in a melted state. When the varnish has become
sufficiently and uniformly black, let the plate cool, and having drawn
the design on transparent paper, rub over the face of it with chalk;
then wipe off most of the chalk with a piece of flannel, lay the
chalked side on the varnish, and trace the lines, somewhat minutely,
with a smooth round pointed needle. Then take up the paper, and proceed
to scoring the lines in the varnish. For this purpose you must be
provided with several needles of different sizes, and fixed in handles,
which may be about four inches long, and nearly half an inch in
diameter, and the needle may project three fourths of an inch from the
handle. Some of these may be ground a little flat on one side, and
others may be round, but taper more abruptly at the point. These
needles may be held, and managed much the same as a pen. Begin scoring
with the out lines, observing to cut completely through the varnish,
but it is not requisite to scratch the copper, except in making very
heavy lines, when it cannot well be avoided. Having finished scoring
the varnish according to the design, fix a border of wax (composed of
two parts bees-wax and one of venice turpentine) round the work, on the
margin of the plate. This border may be about half an inch high, and
must be fixed to the plate while warm. Then pour on as much nitric
acid, diluted with an equal quantity of water, as the plate with the
border will contain. In about fifteen minutes pour off the acid, and
examine whether it has sufficiently corroded any part of the work; if
so, lay a mixture of warm tallow and linseed oil over such parts with a
hair pencil, and again pour on the acid. In half an hour more the acid
may be poured off, and the plate being warmed, the border may be
removed, and the varnish may be wiped off with a piece of linen
cloth;�the plate may then be washed with olive oil, and cleansed as
before with dry fine whiting. <i>Note</i>�Different artists use a
variety of different preparations of varnish for the purpose of
etching. In some old recipes, virgin wax, calcined asphaltum, gum
mastic, amber, colophony, greek pitch, burgundy pitch, black pitch,
resin, shoe makers' wax, &amp;c. &amp;c. are mentioned. But it is believed that
the above described varnish, while it is much more simple, will answer
equally as well for young practitioners; and it is not expected that
any will attempt very nice work, without further information than they
could expect to obtain from the sketches in this little collection.

<p class="item">
58. <span class="sc">Engraving and scraping in mezzotinto.</span>�Having prepared a
plate of copper, proceed to score it so full of lines, cross-lines and
diagonal lines, that when they are filled with ink, the plate may
appear quite black. For this purpose an instrument will be requisite
that is fashioned similar to a chisel, the round or sloping side being
scored or filed near the point, with lines or notches very near to each
other, so as to form a set of sharp uniform teeth at the edge; this
instrument is called a cradle, and should be a little round at the
corners. This cradle must be moved over the plate, in the manner of a
graver, scoring the plate uniformly in various directions. When the
scoring is finished, take a scraper, which may be similar to a knife,
having two edges, and sloping on each side towards the point; with
this, scrape off the roughness of the plate, in such places as is
required to be the lightest in the print; such parts as require to be
shaded partially, may not be scraped so deep, while the points that are
to be the brightest may be burnished quite smooth with the polished end
of a piece of steel, about the size of a large nail, and some of the
heaviest out-lines may be cut with a graver. Thus any portraits or
other figures may be formed on the plate, with due proportion of light
and shade, and will, if properly-managed, give an impression on paper,
equal in elegance to any that might be produced by other means.

warm the plate sufficient to make the powder adhere, but not to melt it
entirely. Transfer the design to the plate, and cover such parts as are
intended to remain white, with a varnish composed of bees wax and
linseed oil, which may be coloured a very little with black, and must
be applied to the work, while warm, with a camel hair pencil. Then fix
a border of wax round the plate, and pour on diluted nitric acid. In
about one minute, pour off the acid, and wash the plate with clear
water, but without effecting the varnish;�dry the plate, and apply the
varnish to such parts of the design as are intended to have but a faint
shade; then apply the acid for a minute or two longer. Thus proceed
biting in, and stopping out alternately, till every part of the design
has acquired its proper shade. But if any part requires a darker shade
than the ground, the powdered rosin may be removed from such parts with
a scraper. When the plate has become sufficiently corroded, the varnish
may be washed off with oil, or spirits of turpentine, and the plate may

the sheets in water severally, and then laying them all together under
a heavy weight till they are used. When the paper is ready, the
copper-plate may be warmed over a chafing dish of coals, and the
engraved side completely covered and all the lines filled with common
printing ink, or ink made of Frankfort black, finely ground in old
linseed oil. This may be done by means of a printing ball, or the ink
may be spread on the plate with a smooth stiff brush. The plate may
then be wiped with a piece of linen or cotton cloth, and afterward with
the hand, being passed slowly but hardly over the plate to take off all
the ink except what remains in the lines of the engraving; to
accomplish which more effectually, the hand may be rubbed occasionally
with dry whiting. When the plate is thoroughly cleaned of the redundant
ink, it may be laid on the table of a rolling press, and having a sheet
of the moistened paper laid upon the face of it, and a piece of fine
broad-cloth over the paper, the whole may be passed through the press.
Then on taking up the paper, it will be found to have received a black
impression from the plate, according to the engraving or etching, and
the plate may be again carried to the fire, to be blacked again as
before. This is the usual manner of printing; but when a rolling press
is not at hand, the plate and moistened paper may by other means, be
pressed hard and firmly together, and the paper will have received the
impression equally as fair. Any of the colours, commonly used in oil
painting, being ground very thick in oil may be substituted for ink in
copper-plate printing. The plate, after being used, should be wiped
clean with a piece of flannel, moistened with olive oil.

61. <span class="sc">Etching letters or flowers on glass.</span>�Select a piece of
glass that is thick and straight, and lay a coat of melted bees-wax on
the fairest side; then with a needle, pen-knife, or any other
convenient pointed instrument, trace any design, or picture, which
being placed under the glass, may be seen through the wax; or form any
letters or figures on the glass, carefully cutting or scoring quite
through the wax, and making the lines large or small as occasion may
require. Then warm a piece of the wax, so as to form it into a roll,
about one fourth of an inch in diameter; lay this roll round the work
upon the glass, and press it down so as to make it adhere to the glass,
thus forming a border. Then take some finely powdered fluate of lime,
and strew it evenly over the glass, on the waxed side, that it may fill
all the lines in the wax; and then gently pour upon it, so as not to
displace the powder, as much sulphuric acid, diluted with thrice its
weight of water, as is sufficient to cover the powdered fluate of lime.
Let every thing remain in this state for three hours; then pour off the
mixture, and clean the glass by washing it with spirits of turpentine.
The figures which were scored in the wax, will be found engraven on the
glass; while the parts which the wax covered, will be uncorroded.�This
glass plate may be charged with ink, (or any thick oil paint) and
impressions may be taken from it on paper, the same as from copper
plates, only caution is requisite, that the glass be not broken by the
pressure. <i>Note.</i>�The fluoric acid, which is partly absorbed by
the water, in the above process, being very corrosive, should not be
suffered to touch the hands, nor any valuable vessel whatever.

marble or slate, and form a smooth plane surface on one side, and on
this, paint any letters or figures with common oil paint of any colour.
When this is dry, wet the stone with water, which will not adhere to
the painted figures, especially if the paints were mixed with old
linseed oil, that will produce a sharp gloss. Then apply a printer's
ink-ball to the plane surface, by which means the dry painted figures
will be covered with the ink, while the bare surface of the stone,
being wet, will not be blackened or affected by it. Press the figured
surface upon some moistened paper, and it will give a fair impression
of the painted figures, on the paper. The block of stone must be then
dipped in the water, and again inked as before, Thus many impressions
may be taken with a tolerable degree of accuracy.

the glass must not rest on any plane surface;) then take a common spike
or some similar piece of iron,�heat the point of it to redness, and
apply it to the edge of the glass; draw the iron slowly forward, and
the edge of the glass will immediately crack; continue moving the iron
slowly over the glass, tracing the pattern, and the chink in the glass
will follow at the distance of about half an inch, in every direction
according to the motion of the iron. It may sometimes be found
requisite, however, especially in forming corners, to apply a wet
finger to the opposite side of the glass. Tumblers and other glasses
may be cut or divided very fancifully by similar means. The iron must
be reheated as often as the crevice in the glass ceases to follow.

equal parts of gum-arabic and loaf sugar in water; or if these are not
at hand, the white of an egg may answer nearly as well. But a strong
water proof cement that is equally transparent, may be made by
digesting finely powdered gum-copal, in thrice its weight of sulphuric

its weight of pondered or scraped cheese, (such as is most void of
cream, or oily matter is preferable) or the curd that is formed by
adding vinegar to skimmed milk;�take the chalk from the fire, and
before it is cold, reduce it to powder, and add as much of it to the

66. <span class="sc">To make a strong water proof glue.</span>�Dissolve common glue
in water in the usual way, and dip into it some clean paper, sufficient
to take up an ounce or more of the glue. When the paper is nearly dry,
roll it up, or cut it into strips and put them into a wide mouthed
phial or flask, with about four ounces of alcohol; suspend this over a
fire so as to boil it gently for an hour, having the cork set in
slightly to prevent its taking fire, but not so as to prevent the
vapour entirely. Then take out the paper (the only use of which is to
give the glue more surface for the action of the alcohol) and add one
ounce of gum-shellac in powder; continue the heat, often shaking the
mixture till the shellac is dissolved. Then evaporate it to the proper
consistence for use. <i>Note.</i>�Many experiments have been made, in
order to discover some aqueous size, that when dry, would resist
moisture: and some have recommended skimmed milk, and others vinegar as
a menstruum for the glue. But it does not appear from trial, that
either of these are but very little better for this purpose than water;
nor is it probable that any similar composition of size will resist
moisture much better than common glue, especially if it be mixed with
sulphate of lime, or some similar substance by way of support.

sifted wood-ashes, and two parts of fine sulphate of lime. Knead this
composition on a board, till it has the consistence of putty. Press a
ball of this putty on any medal, coin or carved work in relief, (which
must be previously oiled) and let it dry; then take off the mould thus
formed, and oil the part that has received the impression of the
figure, with olive oil;�make a small orifice through the mould, from
the centre, or deepest part of the impression; also, pare off the
border of the mould, to within half an inch of the impressed figure.
Then lay a small piece of the putty on the board and press the mould
down hard upon it, that it may not only fill the mould, but that the
redundant part may be pressed out beyond the border of the mould: raise
the mould a little and blow through the orifice, to detach the new
moulded figure from the mould. Thus any number of figures may be
readily produced, suitable for ornamenting chimney pieces, or
mouldings, and which will be very hard when dry, and may be painted
with any coloured oil paints, which will also preserve them from

or staff, one inch in diameter, and fixed in the top of the head. This
model may be made of wood, chalk, or any other substance that is
smooth, and sufficiently cohesive to support itself. This being
prepared, mix fine sulphate of lime with water, to the consistence of
soft putty, and having brushed some olive oil over the model, cover it
completely with the plaster, which must be applied, and spread over it
with the hands, to the depth of two inches or more. When the plaster is
nearly dry, divide it into several parts with a thin blade, so as to
take it off from the model without breaking any part. When the several
parts of the mould are dry, oil them inside and put them together as
before, and bind them with pieces of tape or twine; set the mould
upright, and fill it with a fresh mixture of sulphate of lime and
water, of as much consistence as may be poured in through the aperture
at the head. This plaster should be poured into the mould as quick as
possible after being mixed; otherwise it would become too stiff, and be
spoiled. The plaster in the mould will soon cohere, so that the mould
may be taken off, and the figures may be set up to dry; and the mould
being oiled and put together again, is ready for another cast.

some of the coloured varnish described at 37, and with a hair pencil,
draw the letters, &amp;c. on the marble, (which should be previously well
polished,) and also cover with the varnish, every part of the face of
the marble that is to remain plain. Lay the marble in a horizontal
position and make a border of oil putty round it, and pour on muriatic
acid to the depth of half an inch on the marble. When ebulition
ceases, the acid may be drained off, and the work examined; and if the
letters are not sufficiently prominent, a fresh quantity of the acid
may be added. When the work has been thus corroded to the depth
required, the varnish may be washed off with spirits of turpentine. The
acid that has been thus employed need not be lost, for a muriate of
lime being thus formed, may be crystallized by a slight evaporation,
and preserved for other purposes; or by the addition of a small
quantity of sulphuric acid a sulphate of lime is precipitated, and the
muriatic may be poured off and be used again for the same or a similar
purpose.

<p class="item">
70. <span class="sc">To soften stone.</span>�Marble or granite may be deprived in
some measure, of the property of cohesion by being heated red hot and
then quenched in oil. In this case, the carbonic acid which constitutes
the cohesive property of the stone, is expelled by the heat; and the
vacuum thus produced in its pores, are in some measure, filled by the
oil by the pressure of the atmosphere; by which means the stone
acquires a texture quite different from what it had previously. This
however, is not often applied to any valuable purpose.

71. <span class="sc">To change wood apparently, to stone.</span>�Provide a block, or
plank of soft wood, of the dimensions required, and give it two or
three coats of linseed oil, allowing each to dry. Then having prepared
some pieces of marble or granite as directed in the last experiment,
pulverize them to a gross powder; brush over the wood with a heavy coat
of copal varnish (see 47) mixed with an equal quantity of venice
turpentine; let this rest about an hour, and then strew the stone
powder over every part of it, so as to cover the surface completely. If
marble is to be imitated, the powder of different colours, especially
the white and blue, may be prepared separately, and may be strewed on
the work in such shades as will appear the most natural. Granite may
also be crossed or striped occasionally with streaks of a coarser
grain, which will give it a very deceptive effect. When the varnish is
thus covered with stone, a heavy roller, or round log of wood, having a
blanket folded and wrapped round it, should be rolled over the work,
that the larger grains, (which of course will be the most exposed,) may
the more firmly adhere. In this manner, a very perfect imitation of
stone may be given, and the wood thus prepared will be exceedingly
durable, and will answer for many purposes, as well as real stone.

afterwards be ignited so as to blaze, but may be considered safe with
regard to their taking fire by accident. <i>Note.</i>�Though this

may be done by rolling small quantities between two boards. Lay a few
of these rolls together, and cut them into very small grains, and place
them on a sheet of paper, in a warm place, to dry. The dough may be
prevented sticking to the board while rolling it, by rubbing on the
board, a little of the dry compound powder. When the grains are
thoroughly dry, they are ready for use or experiment. On the same

placed on a shovel, and held over a gentle fire, it will soon explode
with a loud report. It is not, however, attended with any danger. If
two grains of chlorate of potass in powder and one of sulphur be mixed
together, and wrapped in a piece of strong paper, and the paper be then
struck with a hammer, it will also explode with detonation. This
experiment may require some caution. <i>Note.</i>�The percussion

79. <span class="sc">To make the mercurial fulminating powder.</span>�Dissolve half
an ounce of mercury in three ounces of nitric acid, assisting the
solution by a gentle heat. When the solution is cold, pour it upon an
equal quantity of strong alcohol previously introduced into a flask,
and apply a moderate heat till effervescence is excited. (Do not forget
that the mercurial solution must be poured upon the alcohol, and not
the alcohol upon the solution.) A white fume will soon begin to
undulate on the surface of the liquor, and flow through the neck of the
flask, and a white powder will be gradually precipitated. As soon as
any precipitate ceases to fall, quickly pour the contents of the flask
on a filter; wash the powder with pure water, and cautiously dry it by
a heat not exceeding that of boiling water. The immediate washing the
powder is material, because it is liable to the re-action of the nitric
acid; and while any of that acid adheres to it, it is very subject to
be decomposed by the action of light. This powder, if very pure and
nicely made, explodes by percussion, or a moderate degree of heat.
<i>Experiment.</i>�Place one-fourth of a grain of this powder, between
the ends of two slips of paste-board, and paste, or bind them firmly
together;�hold the ends of the slips over the flame of a candle, and
as soon as it becomes warm, it will explode with a loud report. This
composition is less dangerous than the fulminating compounds of gold or
silver, as it never explodes spontaneously; but yet it cannot be
handled with too much caution. <i>Note.</i>�The silver powder, or
fulminating silver, with which torpedoes and waterloo crackers are
charged, is prepared in a similar manner; pure silver being dissolved
instead of mercury, but it is too dangerous to be trifled with.

83. <span class="sc">To produce flame of various colours.</span>�This may be effected
by mixing certain substances with burning alcohol, or by applying them
with the point of a pen-knife, to the wick of a burning lamp or candle.
Thus a beautiful rose or carmine coloured flame may be produced by
muriate of strontia: this is prepared by dissolving carbonate of
strontia in muriatic acid, and evaporating it to dryness. The
preparation for an orange colour, is muriate of lime; (a solution of
marble in muriatic acid, evaporated to crystallization) which should be
exposed to a moderate heat till it is deprived of its water of
crystallization and falls to powder. A fine green tinge is produced by
acetate of copper, or boracic acid; which last is procured by adding
sulphuric acid to a solution of borate of soda (in hot water) till it
has a sensibly acid taste; as it cools, the boracic acid is deposited
in crystals on the sides of the vessel. Camphor gives to flame a blue
colour; and nitrate of strontia (prepared the same as the muriate) a
purple. A brilliant yellow may also be produced by muriate of soda. Any
of these preparations being reduced to powder, may be ignited with
three or four times their weight of alcohol, which should be previously
warmed; and if the vessel that contains it be kept heated also, the
combustion will be the more brilliant.

ounces of nitrate of potass, and four ounces of newly burnt charcoal.
Then make several strong paper cases or cartridges, by wrapping some
strong paper (being moistened with paste,) fifteen or twenty times
round a mould made of wood, which may be one inch in diameter, and ten
inches in length. One end of this mould must be made smaller, being
only one fourth of an inch in diameter for the space of an inch of its
length. The paper must be drawn up close round this neck, and strongly
bound with twine, being thus brought to a shape similar to the neck of
a phial. This neck is called the choke of the cartridge. Take the paper
from the mould, and proceed in the same manner with another. When a
sufficient number of cartridges are thus made and dry, place one of
them in a socket which it will fill up closely, and then fill the
cartridge with the above described compound powder, which must be
thrown into the cartridge in small quantities, and each several
quantity must be rammed or beat down very hard, with a suitable sized
rammer and mallet. In filling the cartridge, small quantities of any of
the flame-colouring preparations, described in the preceding article,
may be added occasionally. When the cartridge is nearly full, some
small balls of cotton, dipped in spirits of turpentine, may be added,
to produce the appearance called stars.�These also, may have some
muriate of strontia, or boracic acid strewed on them. Then place a
circular piece of thick paste board on the materials in the cartridge,
having a small hole through it, communicating with the powder below;
lay upon this, half an ounce of fine gun powder, and fold the paper
down upon it from all sides, cementing the folds firmly with glue, thus
giving the end of the cartridge a conical form. Then bore a hole about
two thirds of the length of the cartridge from the choke with a gimblet
or bit. Fill this hole (which must be as large as the choke, but
tapering towards the other end) with fine gun powder, to the choke, and
fill the choke with the compound, the outside of which may be moistened
a little, the better to keep it in its place. Finish the others in the
same manner, and keep them in a warm dry place till used. They are then
to be lashed firmly to the end of a light pine rod, with the choke
towards the opposite end. The length of the rod, should be about nine
times that of the cartridge. The rocket then being elevated by the rod,
and being ignited at the choke, the compound inside burning intensely,
acts upon the air, and causes it to ascend. The cartridges for fire
wheels, are prepared in the same manner, but are generally smaller; and
instead of being lashed to a rod, they are lashed to the arms of a
wheel, in such manner, that a violent rotary motion is produced by
their combustion.

of the gas, and then remove the cork to another flask, containing two
or three ounces of black oxide of manganese, moistened with sulphuric
acid, sufficient to form with it a soft paste; apply the heat of a

neck of the flask; in this manner, convey into the bladder, nearly half
as much oxygen gas, as it previously contained of hydrogen. Then tie
the stem of a tobacco-pipe in the neck of the bladder, and dip the bowl
of the pipe in a solution of soap in water, (soap-suds) and compress
the bladder a little, so as to swell a bubble from the bowl of the
pipe;�shake off the bubble, which being lighter than atmospheric air
will naturally rise, or float horizontally in the air. If the flame of
a candle be brought in contact with one of these balloons, or floating
bubbles, it will explode with a violent detonation, resembling the
report of a pistol. If this compound gas be forced into the water, so
as to form several bubbles on the surface, and flame be then applied to

in these experiments, that the fire be not communicated to the bladder,
as such an explosion might not be safe.

small glass tube; close one end and then fill the tube with water. Mix
together equal parts of nitrate of ammonia and water, and immerse the
tube in this mixture. The water in the tube will be frozen immediately,
and may be drawn out by the thread. The same effect may be produced by
a mixture of one part muriate of ammonia, one part nitrate of potass,
and three parts of water. For these experiments, the above mentioned
salts should be fresh, dry and finely pulverized previous to mixing;
the mixture should be made in a tin vessel that is coated inside with
bees-wax, and has a flannel wrapper round the outside, and the tube
should be immersed quickly, as soon as the ingredients are mixed. To
produce a greater, or intense degree of cold, a small vessel of water
is first set in one of those freezing mixtures till it becomes very
cold, and then the due proportion of the salts are added to that, and
the tube, &amp;c. immersed in it. The water in the tube may also be frozen,
by continually bathing the outside of it with sulphuric ether: the
evaporation of the ether, carries off the caloric of fluidity, and the
water congeals.

89. <span class="sc">To change the colours of animals.</span>�Any black, or dark
coloured spots on some animals, especially horses, may be effectually
changed to white, by means of any substance that will chafe or blister
the skin; thus a white spot of any shape may be produced on a black
horse, by shaving off the hair from the part that is to be thus marked,
and applying a plaster of spanish flies, or of quick lime moistened
with vinegar; this plaster must be cut to the size and form required
for the mark, and must be kept bound on, till the skin is blistered, or
nearly so. The next coat of hair will infallibly be white. White spots
can be changed to black or brown, only by means of oils or grease.
Bacon fat has been recommended for this purpose, but if the oil or fat
of a bear can be procured, it will prove more efficacious, as this fat
is well known to have a remarkable tendency to darken the colour of
animals and even complexions. But either of these, and in fact, many
other kinds, will answer this purpose if properly applied, and
frequently repeated.

process, would not, it is presumed, be sufficiently interesting to
warrant its insertion. But the manner of reducing the oils to the state

any of the essential oils, (lemon, cinnamon, foxberry, peppermint, &amp;c.)
and shake them together; set the mixture in a warm place for a few
minutes, and if then any opaque or milky appearance remains, a little
more alcohol must be added. When this has become clear, it may be
diluted occasionally with new rum. The essences of foxberry and
cinnamon are coloured with a few drops of tincture of red saunders; and
the essence of lemon, with tincture of turmeric.

93. <span class="sc">To prepare soda water.</span>�Only two articles are requisite
for this preparation; one of which is super-carbonate of soda, or of
potass (sal eratus,) and the other is citric or tartaric acid. The
super-carbonates are formed by passing a stream of carbonic acid gas
(which is produced by adding muriatic acid to pulverized marble)
through a solution of soda or potass in water;�then evaporating till
it crystallizes. Citric acid is prepared from the juice of lemons; and
tartaric acid (which is more generally employed) is procured from
super-tartrate of potass. But these being common articles of commerce,
a more minute description of the process of preparing them, may not, in
this place, be expedient. The compound called soda powders, consists of
about ten grains of either of the super-carbonates, with an equal
quantity of either of the acids, in each paper; this compound being
dissolved in a glass of water, produces violent effervescence, and if
drank off at the time, gives the water a smart and agreeable acid
taste. The salt and acid, if mixed in powder, must be kept perfectly
dry; otherwise, they would act on each other, and soon be spoiled. On
this account, they are frequently prepared in separate papers, and sold
by sets. Soda water is similarly prepared on the larger scale; the
salts and acid being put into a cask of water, which is so confined,
that the carbonic acid can have no other vent than by forcing out the
water through a pipe fixed for the purpose with a tube, &amp;c.

that substances of different colours, or even without colour, by coming
in contact, produce colours very different from that of either of the
ingredients when separate; thus, if a sheet of paper be striped in one
direction with a hair pencil dipped in a solution of sub-carbonate of
potass; and then crossed with a solution of sulphuric acid, diluted
with five times as much water, it will be colourless; but dip it in a
mixture of a weak solution of sulphate of iron, and infusion of nut
galls, and it will instantly become a beautiful plaid; the ground being
purple, striped one way with black and crossed with white. If a similar
paper be striped with sub-carbonate of potass, and crossed with
infusion of galls, and afterward dipped in a solution of sulphate of
iron, it will become purple, yellow, black and white. Dip a piece of
white calico in a cold solution of sulphate of iron and let it dry.
Then imprint any figures upon it with a strong solution of colourless
citric acid, and let this dry also. If the piece be then well washed in
warm water, and afterwards boiled in a decoction of log-wood, the
ground will be dyed either a slate or a black colour, according to the
strength of the metallic solution, while the printed figures will
remain beautifully white. Stain some parts of a sheet of paper a purple
brown, with a mixture of infusion of galls and sulphate of iron; stain
other parts green with a mixture of tinctures of turmeric and litmus;
stain other parts purple with juice of red cabbage; other parts red
with tincture of litmus and muriatic acid; other parts yellow with
tincture of turmeric; wash the remainder of the sheet with a solution
of sulphate of iron, which will remain white. Then print, or draw with
a camel-hair pencil, any figure or figures on every part of the paper,
with a solution of sub-carbonate of potass. On the purple brown, the
figure will be black; on the green it will be purple; on the purple it
will be green; on the red it will be blue; on the yellow, red; and on
the white, it will take a yellow colour. Thus the figure will appear in
colors different from the ground in every part. Immerse a piece of
white cotton in a solution of sulphate of iron�it will remain white;
dip another piece in tincture of turmeric, it will take a yellow; wet
another piece with juice of red cabbage, containing also, a few drops

immersing it in a mixture of tincture of turmeric and litmus; and
another, purple by a mixture of infusion of galls and sulphate of iron.
Let them dry; then immerse them all together in a solution of
sub-carbonate of potass. The white will be changed to a yellow; the
yellow to a red; the red to green; the green to purple; and the purple
to black; and it is not improbable that some black might be materially

fifty or more thin plates of copper, and the same number of plates of
zinc, all of which may be about the size of a dollar, but not so thick.
The copper and zinc plates, may be either cast in moulds, or may be cut
out of rolled plates of the metals. In addition to the plates of copper
and zinc, it is necessary to be provided with an equal number of pieces
of woollen cloth, rather smaller than the metallick plates in size. Let
these be soaked in a solution of muriate of soda, till they have
thoroughly imbibed it; then take them out of the solution, and squeeze
them gently, to force out the superabundant water. Then, having
provided a circular piece of wood, rather larger than the plates, cover
it with tin foil, and on this lay a plate of zinc, upon that a plate of
copper, and then a piece of moistened cloth; next a plate of zinc, &amp;c.
Continue this arrangement of zinc, copper and cloth, till all the
pieces that have been provided are laid on. As the pile began with
zinc, it must be concluded with copper. This pile may be braced
occasionally with strips of glass to prevent its being overthrown, Fix
the end of a piece of metallic wire, in contact with the base, and lay
the end of another piece upon the top of the pile; if thus, the
opposite ends of the wire be brought in contact with each other, or if
they are connected by any conducting body, so as to form a circuit of
conductors, the pile will afford a constant and powerful current of the
galvanic fluid through them for many hours. If the hands be moistened,
and one of them applied to each of the wires, a shock will be received.
Gold and other metals have been melted, and even burnt; and potass,
soda and lime have been reduced to their respective metallic states, by
being made to form part of a galvanic circuit. When the pile is not in
use, it should be taken down, which will preserve it from wear, and the
plates will require to be cleansed occasionally, which may be easily
done by diluted muriatic acid.

other in the centre. The two front apartments are covered at the top,
and each of them have a tube fixed in the front side, near the top,
with a stopcock. The other apartments are open at the top, and
communicate with those in front, by a small aperture near the bottom of
each. These apartments being all filled with water, those in front are
filled, the one with oxygen, and the other with hydrogen gas, which is
done by forcing the gases into them through the tubes in front, which
causes the water to recede through the aperture at the bottom, and
consequently, part of the water is forced over the top of the other
apartments; or rather, may run off through small tubes, fixed for the
purpose, near the top, similar to those in front. When the front
apartments are filled with the gases, (which may be known by the
bubbling in the others) the tubes are stopped, and two leaden pipes are
fixed in them, the opposite ends of which, are so placed, that the two
streams of gas, when expelled from the gas holders, may come in contact
very near the ends of the pipes. When the tubes are open, the pressure
of the water will expel the gases, and will consequently settle, and
must be replenished, so as to keep the apartments nearly full. When the

which, if acid be present, will be changed to red. In the same manner,
alkalies may be detected by a strip of turmeric yellow paper, which
will be also changed to red by alkalies. These tests are sensible to
the presence of an acid or alkali in the proportion of one to ten

will give to the water (if iron be present) a brown tinge. A drop of
sulphuric acid, precipitates barites in the form of a white powder.
Clear transparent lime-water (water in which lime has been slaked and
then suffered to settle) will indicate the presence of carbonic acid by
a milky whiteness. On the same principle, a solution of super-carbonate

Muriatic acid, consequently, is a good test for silver. Acetate of
lead, in solution, is a test for sulphureted hydrogen, which occasions
a precipitate of a black colour. Nitrate of mercury is an excellent
test for ammonia, one part of which, with 30,000 parts of water is

112. <span class="sc">To make crayons of various colours.</span>�Crayons or pastils
consist of various coloured pigments or paints, formed into sticks or
rolls for the purpose of drawing and shading with them in the manner of
lead pencils. But that they may be of uniform texture or hardness,
different ingredients and materials require some variation in the
management. To make white crayons, nothing more is requisite than to
mix superfine or refined whiting with alcohol, to the consistence of
soft putty; form it into rolls of a convenient length and size and let
them dry: or the whiting may be mixed with water and a sufficient
quantity of burnt or calcined sulphate of lime to give the crayons a
sufficient degree of hardness when dry. A great variety of elegant
light colours may be formed by adding to the whiting prepared as above,
small quantities of any of the coloured pigments. The most proper
colors for crayons are lamp-black, prussian blue, burnt umber, burnt
terra-de-sienna, red ochre, vermilion, lake, rose-pink, chrome yellow,
yellow ochre and mineral green. Many other handsome greens are formed
by mixing chrome yellow with prussian blue, varying the proportions;
and purples are produced by mixing rose pink or lake with blue.
Prussian blue and lake being each naturally of a binding nature,
require only to be ground in water; but red ochre and vermilion should
be ground in alcohol, or may have some quantity of the sulphate of lime
mixed with them. Any of these colours may be mixed in any proportion
with whiting or with each other, each compound having a sufficient
proportion of the sulphate of lime, to give it a proper degree of
hardness and strength when dry. The proper length for crayons is from
two to three inches, and the size about the same as that of a
tobacco-pipe stem. It is customary in making crayons, to have at hand a
large piece of chalk with a plane surface, on which to lay the crayons
as soon as they are rolled; the chalk absorbs a part of the moisture,
which makes them dry the sooner and without cracking.

gum-shellac and rosin each two ounces; and of gum-mastic one ounce;
reduce them to powder and mix and melt them together over a gentle
fire. Then if a red colour is required, add to the mixture one ounce of
fine vermilion; for a black colour, add half an ounce of a mixture of
lamp black with rum; for a blue, half an ounce of white lead with one
fourth of an ounce of prussian blue; which should be previously ground
together dry. To give a green colour, add finely ground verdegris; a
yellow is produced by chrome yellow or gamboge; and white, by adding
pure white lead to the mixture. When the desired colour is formed by
the mixture and incorporation of any of the above mentioned colouring
ingredients, take out a part of the mixture, sufficient to form a stick
or roll of the usual size, and roll it between two smooth metallic
plates, which should also be previously warmed to prevent the wax from
becoming too hard. When the stick is reduced to a proper size, flatten
it a little and let it cool. Proceed in the same manner with the rest
of the composition; afterward hold each stick severally over a fire of
charcoal, turning it quickly till the surface of the wax is completely
melted, by which means the sticks will have acquired a very smooth and
shining polish at the surface, which they will retain when cold again.
If a softer wax is required, a small quantity of bees-wax and of
linseed oil may be added to the above composition, or may be
substituted in the place of the gum-mastic.

114. <span class="sc">The art of manufacturing paper hangings.</span>�This business,
which has been usually, though improperly termed paper staining,
consists principally in stamping or painting various figures in water
colours on paper. The paper for this purpose is formed into long strips
or rolls, by pasting the edges of several sheets together. The edges of
the sheets should not lap on each other more than half an inch, and the
usual length of a roll is about nine yards. These rolls are first
painted plain with a large brush; the paint is composed of refined
whiting with some colouring ingredient, being ground in water and
tempered with a sufficient quantity of glue to prevent it from rubbing
off; when a new design or figure is to be introduced, several colours
are prepared, i.e. as many as are required in such design, and with
these the design is painted on a sheet of paper. The paper is then laid
on a smooth birch or maple board, and such parts of the paper as
contain the colour that was last applied in the drawing (which is
usually the white) are completely cut out, with a sharp pen-knife, and
the parts thus cut out, are pasted down upon the board, immediately, in
the places and positions they occupied in the design. The sheet is then
removed to another board, and another colour is cut out in the same
manner; thus the several colours are distributed in their proper
arrangements on as many different boards. Each board is then cut away
with chisels and gouges, to the depth of a fourth, or an eighth of an
inch, in every part except where the pieces of paper are fixed. These
boards or prints are supported by other thin pieces, which are fixed
firmly on the backs of them by screws, in such manner that the grain of
one, crosses that of the other, and thus prevents their warping. They
have also cleats or pins attached to them which serve as handles. A
trough is provided, a little larger than the prints, of one inch in
depth, and having a smooth bottom, on which is laid three or four
pieces of fine flannel or cassimere, each of which is at least as large
as the prints. Then some of the colour with which the first part of the
design was painted, is spread upon the cloth with a brush; and upon
this, the print containing the corresponding parts of the figure, is
pressed, (the pieces of paper having been previously scraped off;) the
print being thus charged with the colour, is placed upon one end of a
roll of the prepared paper, which is laid on a table for that purpose,
and is pressed down hard by a lever or screw. It is then returned to
the trough, and again charged with the colour, and again impressed on
the paper at a proper distance above the other impression. In this
manner several rolls are printed with one colour. Then the next colour
in the design is applied to the paper in the same manner by another
print;�a third colour by a third print and so on till the paper is
completely printed with every colour in the design, each in its proper
place. These prints should be washed and kept dry for future use. A
variety of figures may be produced with the same print, by varying the
colours.

115. <span class="sc">To make elastic blacking for leather.</span>�Dilute one ounce
of gum-asphaltum with a pint of spirits of turpentine, in the manner
described at 51;�put this into a flask, and add one ounce of
gum-elastic cut into very small pieces, and half an ounce of
gum-shellac previously reduced to powder. Suspend the flask unstopped
over a fire of charcoal, or set it in a sand bath where it may boil
gently till the quantity is reduced to a gill; then strain it through a
flannel, and when nearly cold, bottle and cork it. The leather should
be thoroughly blackened with some liquid blacking and waxed over
slightly with bees-wax before the elastic blacking is applied. If the
blacking should be too thick, it may again be diluted with spirits of
turpentine. It should be warmed when applied, and the work may require
several coats, and a considerable time for each to dry. Any of the
above mentioned gums may also be dissolved in sulphuric ether, and thus
produce a fine drying varnish, but the preparation is much more
difficult as the volatile nature of the ether will not admit of much
heat, whereby to facilitate the solution.

<p class="item">
116. <span class="sc">Sundry Experiments.</span>�Rub together a little dry powdered
alum, and acetate of lead; both will become fluid. To a saturated
solution of muriate of lime, add a saturated solution of sub-carbonate
of potass, (both transparent liquids,) the mixture will be nearly
solid. Rub together a little pure white calomel (sublimed mercury) and
pure white ammonia (being moistened;) both will become intensely black.
Fill a flask nearly half full of water, and apply heat till it boils;
take it from the fire and (when it has done boiling) cork it; pour cold
water upon the flask, and the water inside will re-commence boiling.
Fill a glass with water, and lay a piece of paper upon the top of it;
place your hand upon the paper, and invert the glass; the hand may be
removed and the glass may be suspended in that position by a thread,
and the water will not be spilled. Expose a piece of ice to the action
of (cold) muriatic gas; the ice will be instantly melted. Drop a piece
of phosphuret of lime, into a glass of water; bubbles will soon rise,
and on reaching the surface of the water will spontaneously explode.
Apply the end of a roll of brimstone to a hot bar of iron; a part of
the iron will be instantly melted, and will fall. Write with diluted
sulphuric acid, on paper that has been coloured brown by a mixture of
sulphate of iron, and infusion of galls; the writing will be white.
Moisten the under lip, and lay upon it a piece of silver money, (not
less than a twenty cent piece) with the edge of it beneath the tongue;
lay a piece of zinc, of nearly an equal size, upon the tongue, and
bring the edges of the pieces of metal into contact; you will instantly
drop the money.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
